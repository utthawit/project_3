My mid 90's vintage  eurocave v264 has started playing up in the cold weather.

When it's warm the compressor kicks in fine and cools to maintain an accurate temperature of 13°c as set.

 However when the temperature drops and it attempts to heat something is going wrong and the unit is tripping my mcbs on the electrical distribution board.

Does anyone have manuals or an understanding of how the unit provides heating before I empty it out and dismantle it to attempt a fix?

Am tempted to just leave it for the winter and wait for spring hoping it insulated well enough to keep the temperature stable.

Light straw in color.

Fairly closed on the nose but hints of green and yellow apple, lemon zest, yeasty bread, and a bit of cream.

On the palate, medium to medium plus acidity that dissipates quickly, green and yellow apple, lemon, a bit bready... similarities to a flat blanc de blancs champagne in flavor profile. Enjoyable with our paired fried fish, langoustine, and other seafood.

Light straw in color with very fine and light bubbles. 

A bit closed on the nose but gentle aroma of brioche, lime skin, candied lemon, grape soda.

On the palate, brioche, green apple, mandarin, lemon peel, lime cordial, with a bit of flinty minerals on the finish which is very long. 

Overall wanting a bit more on the nose but a very luscious and easy drinking champagne with a beautiful lingering finish.

92+ points.

1972 Taylor Fladgate Late-Bottled Vintage Port:

Deep copper in color, slight cloudiness and small amount of sediment.

On the nose, golden raisin, milk chocolate, caramel, cinnamon, dates.

On the palate, confirming the nose with hints of dried candied orange peel and baking spices.

A bit more diluted, and reflective of a somewhat weaker vintage but enjoyable nonetheless.

Best QPR in Piedmont?,105,1gid2u7,https://i.redd.it/pimtpk5zllyd1.jpeg,67,2024-11-03 09:33:50,"Reposting because original was removed. 

These are becoming my two go-to Barolos for highest QPR. The Vajra I feel is pretty commonly suggested to punch higher than the price. The Vietti is a staple producer and is hard to go wrong. For between $35-$45 it’s hard to beat this. 

Do you have any suggestions that you feel are better for high QPR in this region?

Notes: I had these both earlier today so I have to  off memory so my post doesn’t get removed. 

Vajra: classic brick Barolo color, bright red cherry, rose, tar, slight licorice. Medium high tannin, medium high acidity. Lots of fresh red fruit, well balanced. 92.

Vietti: Slightly more ruby than brick. Also lots of bright red fruit, tar, almost a meaty scent as well to it. Extremely smooth tannins balanced with a bright acidity. Well balanced and potential to cellar. 93. 

The 2020 year so far is close to 2019. Seriously a great vintage so far, lots of depth and potential to cellar. Still very young but the Barbaresco’s and Langhe Neb are drinking beautifully now.  ",wine,"Best QPR in Piedmont? Reposting because original was removed.

Heavy notes of sweet vanilla, and oak that’s of an unnatural character. The fruit is a non-distinct mix of mostly dark and some red. I can make out lots of blackberry,  and some cherry and smoke.

Heavy notes of sweet vanilla, and oak that’s of an unnatural character. The fruit is a non-distinct mix of mostly dark and some red. I can make out lots of blackberry,  and some cherry and smoke.

This is neither elegant or structured. I would honestly look elsewhere for a quality pinot. It doesn’t even taste that good generally. 

This ain’t it. "
My first Jurançon Sec,17,1gh1t3x,https://i.redd.it/qp8oaimfj9yd1.jpeg,6,2024-11-01 16:58:13,"Clos Cancaillaü Au Lavoir Jurançon Sec 2019

Lionel Osmin & Cie

Med golden colour

Nose: lots of lees-y, almost champagne-like brioche notes, citrus, and vanilla

Palate: very concentrated, expressive citrus notes (orange peel, lemon), well integrated oak (vanilla, lees characteristics), minerals, very long finish

Beautiful freshness really helps balance out the high alcohol (15%) and oak notes, gives it energy and acidic grip that melts into a long, waxy finish. Not usually a fan of big oaky whites, but that was very moreish. 

Got it on clearance and sad I didn’t get everything they had.

With some air and time it began to reach equilibrium with notes of spice, glimpses of wet soil, loam, espresso grinds & milk chocolate.

Immediately this gushed with vivid notes of blue fruits… think cocoa dusted blueberries & sappy cassis. With some air and time it began to reach equilibrium with notes of spice, glimpses of wet soil, loam, espresso grinds & milk chocolate.

So fresh and precise still this could go longer easily.

Triolet 2020 - Less salinity and complexity, this was a challenging vintage. Similar lemon and lime but also a little grassy yet a little brighter than the 2015. Citrus galore on the palate, however feels thinner and less complex. 

Triolet 2022 - The standout for the Triolet here, this one is so well integrated. Has complexity beyond the 2015 and also tastes older than the 2015. Zippy yet creamy and well balanced. 2022 is a great vintage.

Chardonnay 2020 - Buttery and rich on the nose, refreshing salinity and yellow fruits. Still great complexity for this challenging year. 

Chardonnay 2021 - Like the 2020 but more fresh, more acidity and more fruit forward. A buffed up version of the 2020.

Chardonnay 2022 - Okay so what a vintage for the whites this is, so complex and drinking well beyond its years. This is a standout and so well integrated already, this would be exciting to revisit in 10 years. 

Marli Russell 2021 - A new endeavour by Mount Mary focusing on Rhone varieties grown and vinified at the estate. Big red fruit nose, core of strawberry and jam, smells like a farmers market. The palate is light and fresh with strawberry, cranberry, light as a feather, wow! Young Grenache vines so it’s less concentrated fruit and lacks the earthiness you expect from a GSM. 

Marli Russell 2022 - This one has darker fruits, jammy plum and boysenberry, very brooding on the nose. Palate similar to the 2021 but more concentrated fruits. 

Pinot Noir 2021 - Very excited, my favourite Australian Pinot, feels like its weightless on the nose, dark red fruit core, porcelain on the palate it’s so delicate, floats effortlessly with a trio of strawberry, slight pepper and vanilla pods.

Quintet 2014 - Deep and concentrated, blackcurrant and boysenberry with dried vanilla pods. Dark and ripe red fruits converging on a medium body. 10 years on and could still go a long way! 

Quintet 2017 - More liquorice and pronounced red fruits compared to the 2014, I get a little eucalyptus too. This one could almost fool me as Margaret River in a blind tasting. 

Quintet 2021 - Lost the eucalyptus note entirely, more earthy with deep red fruits with much more concentration. Excellent balance, great oak and vanilla perfectly integrated.

Gorgeous space, great staff, was a super welcoming and family friendly environment. Doesn't seem to be quite as... discovered... by the Instagram croud like Pippin Hill and King are.

I grabbed this bottle of their Pinot noir, curious they're even growing it there at all, quite uncommon around there. Also I just love Pinot, what can I say? Didn't have terribly high expectations.

I was more than impressed. My immediate impression was ""old world,"" which really hit all the right notes for my own preference in Pinots. Gorgeous light ruby color, quite transparent. It has some bright cherry and herb notes on the nose, a little earthy. Palate is very nicely balanced, plenty of well integrated tannin, very bright acidity, fresh zippy red fruits and a good undercurrent of herbs and that wet leaves thing from a good Savigny Les Beaune. It needs the oak to lend a little bit of body, it's quite light. A touch linear, not going to confuse this with your good burgs or Willamette bottles, but I could easily blind call this a villages cote de beaune, Santenay, Fixin, etc along those lines. 13.5% ABV. 50% new oak for 11 months.

I really liked it, brought half a case home. Not cheap at $45 ish a bottle, but it's one of the best VA reds I've had. I'd give it maybe 90-91 points something like that.
