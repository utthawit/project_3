We happened upon a roughly $25 bottle of AOC Vouvray Chenin Blanc and, wow. By far my favorite white wine experience thus far. Great flavor but left nothing overt on the tongue (no buttery oaky essence, or stone or anything. Just refreshing. 

So now friends, what other Chenin Blancs should I look into. What are some standard bearers and some great mid range vineyards. 

Note: I usually tend to drink bottles in the $40-80 range.

Thanks for helping me drink a 50 year cab,123,1go438u,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1go438u/thanks_for_helping_me_drink_a_50_year_cab/,9,2024-11-10 23:12:00,"I posted last year about buying a 50 year old wine.  After your suggestions, I found one from an online auction and bought it.  Living in the ""great"" state of Alabama, I had to have it shipped to a package store where they could charge me 29cents extra in taxes.   So weird.    You also suggested that a 50 year old cab would likely not be very good and to have a backup bottle, so I went to the store and without realizing it, bought another cab from the same vineyard.  So we had a bottle from 1974 and 2020.  Fortunately, the 74 was actually pretty good.  The color had faded a bit, and it had lost ""something"", but otherwise was enjoyable.  I would equate it to listening to a song and turning the bass all the way down.  You know what you are listening to and you might even start hearing a couple things you wouldn't have noticed normally, but there is definitely something missing.  Anyway, thanks for the help, it went very well!

Iâ€™m a somm in Australia, usually if I have to make a selection for wines to consider and I havenâ€™t tried one Iâ€™ll default to Halliday to give me a rough idea of what to expect quality wise. Usually pretty reliable and really a great reference book as well.

When I look internationally, Iâ€™ve been using Suckling as my go to for looking at wines that I havenâ€™t had before and to be honest, I just donâ€™t agree with the ratings as much, lots of very average but highly rated wines, I feel like I just canâ€™t use it reliably as a resource for my job anymore. Also, not as comprehensive as Iâ€™d like as well.

What do you guys think are great resources for wines within each region? Like a great Spain or Italy guide, maybe even region specific like burgundy or Bordeaux. Specifically USA? Or South America?

Iâ€™d rather have 10 great guides then one just okay guide"

The cooked wine experiment ,10,1goekwq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1goekwq,4,2024-11-11 06:48:59,"Ever wonder what would happen if you left wine in a 110 degree room for 11 days? Well, let me tell you because this is exactly what happened to our friendsâ€™ wine. 

Their house had to go through water remediation and part of the process was to blast their basement with hot air machines, which unfortunately cooked all their wine. While the wine wasnâ€™t anything high end or fancy, there were certainly a couple of bottles which I was familiar with that I was definitely sad to hear were ruined. 

Nothing turned into vinegar or tasted like stewed fruits surprisingly. The main theme was that pretty much all of them tasted flat and smelled like nothing. They werenâ€™t disgusting, just veryâ€¦blah. Meh. Pretty much flavorless. 

The only exception was the 19 Crimes. It was terrible, but that probably wasnâ€™t due to the heat. The heat did seem to kill the nose, but I picked up some weird root beer, sarsaparilla, cream soda, cola note, definitely like fake sugary kind of note. 

On the palate, it was some kind of caramel and Dr Pepper with a hint of cherry robitussin. I almost spit it out because it was so nasty. 

It was honestly kind of exciting how bad it was, considering everything else was so flat. If youâ€™ve heard of movies that are so bad theyâ€™re good, this was almost like that, but with wine, and it wasnâ€™t actually good. But it was fun making fun of the 19 Crimes wine and very educational to taste the other wines that had been damaged by heat.

Oh - the Prosecco honestly wasnâ€™t too bad either, but La Marca isnâ€™t great to begin with, so the bar was pretty low, but it still had good fizz and didnâ€™t taste all that noticeably worse than a normal bottle! "

Stood up 12 hours before drinking and opened two hours ahead of dinner. Decided to slow ox instead of decant, so the wine wouldn't fall apart.

Initially, needed time to open up, but after a couple hours, this was beautiful.

Notes of dark plum, dark cherry, arugula, allspice, and clove.

Long finish, mellow tannins and acidity.

I have a lot of hobbies that that lend themselves to that lifestyle lol. I donâ€™t usually find wine, but this was too crazy of a find to pass up.  I spent $20 all in. Iâ€™m erring on the side of all of them being dead.  Certainly going to open these up over time, and I will definitely report back. Left to right..

Petrus 1970.  Mid low shoulder fill.  Insanely depressed cork. I want so bad for this to be a miracleâ€¦

Haut Brion 1974 - Iâ€™d bet everything that this is toast. Never seen such low ullage. Iâ€™m still gonna open it up and smell it. Who knows? The bottle is a really interesting shape. 

Weingut Dr. Alex Senfter - nierfteiner Orbel Riesling Beerenauslese 1976 - this one has a nice looking level, but brown glass makes it hard to tell whatâ€™s inside.  Kinda have some hope for this one..

Beaulieu Vineyard private reserve 1971 - if only the petrus had the fill level of this one.  Decent cork and capsule position. Cellar tracker notes are not inspiring, but Iâ€™d be glad to open this up for science.

Porto Barros 1890 - I started shaking when I picked this one up haha. Not too familiar with ports this old.  The wax on the capsule is super crusty looking. The fill level is right to the top of the shoulder.  I have pretty high hopes for this one.

Offley Vintage Port 1963 - upper mid shoulder fill. Cork seems a little depressed. 

Out of all of these, I really want the Petrus and 1890 port to shock me. "

I'm a burgundy noob, so take my notes with a grain of salt.

Chateau De La Tour

Nose: Very balanced between red fruit, earth, tiny amount of spice, and a dusty note.

Palate: Very complex. Notes of spce, like black pepper, leather, tobacco, hints of red fruit. Very balanced. Also one unique note I can't describe, but it wasn't something I'm used to. Very high concentration of flavor, medium-high body

Finish: medium tannins, strong leather, dark chocolate, spice in the initial finish

Nicolas Rossignoe

Nose: More earthy on the nose, not much fruit, spice

Palate: Similar to the nose, earthy, leather, black pepper. Less concentration than the previous, slightly watery, but still very good.

Finish: Low tannins, but still present, slight amoumt of dark chocolate bitterness, good length

Two very good wines overall. I preferred the De La Tour, but these are basically my first two burgundies ever. Normally, we drink bordeaux, barolo, chianti, or Rioja and occasionally some new world wines, but not much Pinot in general. I did some research and found these wines over the past month and now I think I might have gotten some of my co-workers addicted to burgundy lol."

Wasnt familiar with the producer, but plenty of available info!Grapes harvested on September 7, 2019 - then 15 months ageing on fine lees. Stored at 55, popped and poured - no decanting. Paired with a grilled salmon and some rice.

Visually, a strong ruby color, hints of purple at the edge. Beautiful color.

On the nose, I went in expecting the usual red fruits of a gamay - was incredibly surprised to pick up herbs and spices reminiscent of the Southern Rhone! Less flowers than I expected. Deeper into the glass, blueberries - with a hint of the usual strawberries and cherries I expected. Fantastic scents for a gamay, I'm sure partly thanks to the terroir of this Cru.

On the palate - medium bodied, yet still refreshing to drink. A pleasant tannin grip, perhaps I should've aired it out a little - yet balanced, with a good bit of acidity. No notable burn at all (label shows it as 11-14% ABV? Wild LOL. Never seen an abv >range< before.) Dry. Flavors of blackberry pie, blueberry jam - bit of pepper at the tail end. The herbs continue - a fantastic bit of complexity at the price point. Nice long finish. This was $25?

My first Cote-de-Brouilly, and I'm absolutely blown away here. The nose, the palate - fantastic value here. Delicious in every way, and I cant wait to track down other producers. Highly recommended!!"

Great communication, and we ended up spending nearly three hours there. Seeing their horses, cellar, production facility, historic home, and vines was one of the highlights of our trip. The clarets and field blends were great and extremely interesting blends. The work theyâ€™ve done on their property and vines is evident in the product and the passion for what theyâ€™re doing. They were even kind enough to share what was left of a 92 vintage Niepoort (a birth year for several of us). 

We ended up buying several bottles and left with a few gifts from u/aligotegozaimasu as well! Their hospitality and kindness was above and beyond, and we couldnâ€™t have been more thankful for the time they spent to show us their work.

One thing that's been occupying my idle brain since ages is defining objective criteria for wine quality. Not a single score, definitely not a list of aromas and flavors, but relatively easily measurable characteristics that would correlate with the ""quality"", i.e, serve as a buying guideline for an intelligent but not-very-well-versed-in-wine-yet human.

Say, my wife sees Chateau TrouvÃ© for 20$, Chateau Perdu for 200$, and Chateau Ã‰garÃ© for 35$ in a shop. She checks the notes and they are like ""... minty-edge to the cedar, tobacco, cigar box..."", ""... dried roses, mint, tobacco, dried cherries..."", ""... mint, smoke, cherries and raspberries..."" â€” absolutely unhelpful for her to make a choice (she grabs the one with the nicest label or the one with more medals). What I think would help her, or some redditors here, to make an informed decision, is to mention that, say, the bottle of Ã‰garÃ© for 35 bucks is better balanced and is a bit more complex than TrouvÃ© for 20$.

Not sure asking AI helps (yet?). For example, Gemini seems to care more about classification, reputation, and critic reviews, not to mention it often gets basic facts wrong.

With that, here are a few of my criteria to seed the discussion:

* Balance, both in main compounds (acid, alcohol, sugar, polyphenols) and in taste perception

* Duration of the aftertaste

* Complexity of the story the wine tells, e.g., ""light and fruity nose but surprisingly deep note of cherry that evolves into whatnot and becomes thisthat...""

What are yours?"

"2020 Domaine de Leyre-Loup Fleurie | Too much Cru Beaujolais, not enough time!",8,1gmqth4,https://i.redd.it/greitv5fbqzd1.jpeg,1,2024-11-09 02:27:42,"Purchased a bottle to go along with dinner at a local wine bar, No Reservations, in Miami - was in the mood for some Cru Beaujolais when I walked in, so happy to see it on the menu! Paired with grilled lamb chops. Served a little cold (felt like 35-40), but warmed up as the night went on - not decanted.

Visually, a strong purple color - once I put my flash to it!

On the nose, bountiful floral scents at the rim - a bouquet of lovely fresh flowers on a spring day. Deeper into the glass, strong notes of ripe strawberries and cherries. Took a bit to open up - but I pin that more on the serving temperature than anything.

On the palate, fantastically crisp and refreshing, especially chilled. Lightly bodied, pleasant acidity, barely any notable tannin grip - par for the course with the grape. Dry, with perceived sweetness due to the strong ripe red fruit flavor more so than any actual sugar. That same nose of cherries and strawberries resumed on the palate, bountiful red fruit. Delicious, albeit no real complexity of flavor to me. Decent finish, and a great pairing with the lightly seasoned lamb and vegetable salad.

The bottle went for $58, but the host reduced it to $29 for me, and for a restaurant bottle at that point, I was definitely very satisfied with the value (since $58 gets me some good Big 4 Morgon). Took half the bottle home where it promptly didn't survive the night. Will happily continue pursuing Fleurie and the other Crus (eyeing a particular Cote de Brouilly for tonight)! Looking up the producer online, I was happy to see them using very sustainable and organic farming methods, which will have me choose them again soon. Recommended! 

(Oh, and for any locals, the wine bar I mention above is fantastic)"

So far I've explored a bunch of red wines and figured out what I **don't like:**

1. Heavy, full, overly sweet reds (e.g. a lot of California reds like Zinfandel/Cabs)

2. Musty, chocolate, spicy, earthy tones

  
What I **do like:**

1. Lighter wines (leaning dry, but some amount of sweetness is nice)

2. Love love the chillable red wines

3. Floral/fruity scent/taste but not toooo sweet

4. Generally, I've found that the wines I like have a translucent/transparent reddish color? (like a french pinot/gamay?)

Color was a perfect red amber. Tobacco, black pepper, dark fruit, and tar on the palate. Well-balanced with a lengthy finish. Pleasant acidity. Pulled the original cork and re-corked with new, so I could use my Coravin. That's usually my move on these older bottles. Now I can finish the bottle over the next few weeks, with a small glass here and there. As an aside, I've noticed wines, while protected from ruin, do continue to evolve after tapping with the Coravin. So, I expect it will continue to improve over the coming days. "

Out of curiosity, I researched online if there are any licenses involved. As you might expect, I got a lot of different answers, but no real final say.
I did find some sources claiming that wine is considered food and, therefore, you need full-on food licensing.

So at what point does a wine tasting room need a food license?  Does anyone with experience in tasting rooms have the answer?

just had a lovely meal in Paris with a bottle of wine that was pleasant to start, but unfortunately became noticeably mousey within 45 minutes. I'm more than open to natural wines, and have served and sold many, but typically I'm more used to wines that turn around the second day mark and was unpleasantly surprised that this was so noticeably faulty before the mains even hit the table.

This got me thinking about the changes in the dynamics of wine consumption and how the industry reacts to it. The whole process of tasting a wine prior to serving is focused on cork taint... So while working as a Somm, I would accept a return from a guest where the cork taint became prominent over time (ie not noticed immediately upon serving to the guest), I don't know how I would feel about a wine that became mousey over the course of a meal... Conversely, as a guest, I didn't feel comfortable returning a wine that had become mousey (even though it happened so fast).

I feel like I'm rambling a bit, but I'm curious - if you're eating in a restaurant, under what circumstances would you return a bottle of wine that had gone mousey? Do you think mousiness is given more of a ""free pass"" than other taints? And if so, do you think thats fair?

Hopefully I'm not opening a can of worms here but I'm interested. Both as someone who is neither staunchly pro or anti natural wine, but also as a consumer who is usually on the other side of the interaction.

Appreciate your insights. Cheers."

Quintessa: known for its long history of organic/biodynamic winemaking practices. 91% Cab Sauv and 60% new French oak. Dark berry fruit and granular, smooth tannins. Great acidity. 

Ornellaia: Bolgheri blend of 62% Cab Sauv, 31% Merlot, and a dappling of Petite Verdot and Cab Franc. Chalky tannins, earthy, tomato vine, and a jab of VA that improved with time in the glass. This one needs the most time to show itself out of all the wines tasted today. 

Chateau Mouton-Rothschild: lots of green bell pepper up front that integrated better with time in the glass. Angular, muscular, lots of personality.

I've got one more stored away and I think I'll plan to keep it until about 2030 based off tasting this one. 

This like most post 1990 disznoko is a spectacular example of what tokaji can be. I opened this bottle for about 15min and then decided to decant and start to taste after another 15-20min in the decanter. We ended up drinking it over the next hour. 

Upon starting to drink this it was extremely bright, lemon curd, dried apricot, fresh ginger, white peaches, and the trademark botytris funk. Still quite fresh and lively. Weighty and sweet but had substantial acid to back it up. Over time it got a bit more subdued on acidity and came really into balance and opened up to where I feel it was ideal after around an hour or so open. Towards the end of the bottle it did begin to lean a little bitter and flabby as it had started falling off. Still plenty of life left but definitely thinking it will be in its prime with only a quick decant off sediment before drinking with good company in 5-6 years. "
2009 Drouhin Oregon Chardonnay REVIEW,44,1gkosej,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gkosej,4,2024-11-06 10:05:03,"Updating from an earlier post, with my first review here on r/wine! 

Iâ€™ve slowly gotten into the wine world over the last few years, and working in the fine dining industry, Iâ€™m lucky to be exposed to a lot of higher level bottles and people who are amazing and willing to share. My first epiphany moment with wine, the sip that turned on the light bulb, was a 2010 Roulot white burgundy. I was so intrigued and so thrown off by the amount of flavors and textures and feelings that the wine thrust upon me, I didnâ€™t know how to react. Following this experience, I was sent into a two year foray into white burgundy and have found myself with significantly lighter pockets since. As an avid drinker of Nebbiolo and lover of Italy, I had sworn France to be overrated and dull. Boy, did this day prove me wrong! 

Ive been chasing that dragon since, and landed on Meursault and Pouilly-Fuisse, or more southern burg whites as my palettes choice due to the richness, creaminess, and more oak, as opposed to higher acid and steely-clean, crisp Chablis counterparts. 

Today, we have a bottle that intrigued me when I saw it, excited me when I got home and did some research, and blew my mind when I opened it. 

2009 Drouhin â€œArthurâ€ Oregon Chardonnay, found this among 4-5 more, covered in dust in a south Florida liquor store. Hereâ€™s my novice review so we can all get this over withâ€¦

Med-deep gold color, almost amber, gold flake and perfectly hued. Intense nose, flooded with deep, rich, and creamy apple orchard notes, little bit of flint, lot of brown butter and seriously (SERIOUSLY) heavy popcorn, but it was so good, no chemical traces, just organic pure old butter. Insanity. Wine was dry, weighty, but so well integrated, little bit of tannin (from oak maybe?) but it was so dang smooth. Medium acid, high alcohol, full body, intense flavor, crazy long finish. This wine is outstanding and was preserved so well! 
Iâ€™m going to buy the rest tomorrow. Overall 9/10 and blew my expectations out of the water. So balanced, so tertiary. Rich and smooth oak, toasted sourdough, kombucha and apples, buuuttterr, brown butter, more butterâ€¦. Lots of vanilla and little nutmeg, soft cheeseâ€¦ marmaladeâ€¦ man it just keeps going. Thanks for reading and if you see one of these, I canâ€™t recommend it enough. The age has done this wine such a service and Iâ€™d say this is its prime. "

"Wine buying for beginners, how do I decide what is good and bad?",3,1gkvlpn,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gkvlpn/wine_buying_for_beginners_how_do_i_decide_what_is/,18,2024-11-06 17:38:47,"I like good wine, to no oneâ€™s surprise. But Iâ€™m having a hard time pricing out which region, grape, method or whatever to buy for what I need it for. I have a few go to vineyards that I know are good and cheap, but Iâ€™d like to expand on that. 

So, imagine youâ€™re in a supermarket (thatâ€™s where I usually go if I donâ€™t want to spend a fortune), you donâ€™t know any of the wines, and your Vivino app isnâ€™t working.  You know what occasion you need it for (meal, pre dinner, sparkly and whatever). How do you pick out a bottle?

Are there any information on the bottle, country, the price, the grape or anything that helps you decide? Iâ€™d imagine going for offers lets your money stretch to a better wine, but more expensive doesnâ€™t always equal better in my limited experience. 

Let me know your thought process"

Has Port wine perception declined?,32,1gkdqum,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gkdqum/has_port_wine_perception_declined/,68,2024-11-06 01:34:59,"I'm from Portugal and have never been a big fan of Port, like most Portuguese. I think I can speak for the majority.  
It's been an overseas export from day #1 due to the fortification.   
All the terminology of styles is in English language rather then Portuguese (except for ""Colheita"").   
Its perceived as having a sort of an aristocratic personality.   
In reality none of those perceptions is wrong. But instead of attracting people, it scares them away.

I have the feeling that most people has not had a first good experience with Port. There's a lot of basic/cheap Port flooding the shelves and very little top tier cuveÃ©s or older blends...

  
I would love to know your opinion. How do you look at Port? Have you had a good/very good experience?

Have you ever thought of visiting the Douro region to get into Port. Or that's something now worthwhile for you?

Question for viticulturalists,1,1gkwsb5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gkwsb5/question_for_viticulturalists/,1,2024-11-06 18:56:17,"Is it possible to grow vines in such a way as to get the improvement in quality at a younger age?
As I understand, this improvement comes due to a bigger/deeper root structure and in general only after 15-20 years will vines start to approach their potential in terms of quality production.
My question is, if there are no constraints on the grower, can this be attained sooner? For instance, no irrigation and aggressive pruning to next to no yield, would this result in better quality wine, sooner?"

Black cherry and more earthly notes. Maybe even leather? Missing some nuance on the front end and really hitting heavily in the mid-mouth.

Really fresh tasting, stereotypical fruits for Pinot, cleaner style with little forest floor or mushroom character.

Outstanding persistence, good varietal character, just crunchy enough to let you know thereâ€™s cab franc and have it be a feature, still had a really lush red plum character without feeling overblown, great tension. I was over worried that it would be tired and popped and poured. Kept growing for hours. The cheval des andes was the star. Iâ€™ve had younger Malbecs that donâ€™t have the muscles this had. Didnâ€™t drink like a young wine obviously. Really a master class in balance. Blackberry, tobacco, sanguine, light bell pepper in the South American style. Enough acidity to stand up to any food. 

The 2016 lâ€™enclos was insurance and not opened.


For food, I made beech mushroom toasts with magic dust seasoning from the hitching post and a red wine reduction. Those were aimed at the Pinots and paired well.

For the Bordeaux blends it was cheeseburgers with onion rings. Gave them smoke to 115 and then finished on a skillet. Seasoned with oregano, mushroom powder, sumac, basil, and nutmeg. Onion rings got hop cat crack fries seasoning. A little sweet. "

Visiting Jerez - Field Report & Recommendations,20,1gjonqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gjonqf/visiting_jerez_field_report_recommendations/,13,2024-11-05 03:41:28,"With Sherry Week kicking off today, I wanted to share my experience and recommendations from a trip to the incredible region of Jerez in early October.

**Background**: Iâ€™m based in Poland and got interested in Sherry two years ago through WSET 2. Earlier this year, I completed an intermediate course by Consejo Regulador Vinos de Jerez. I donâ€™t speak Spanish.

**Getting There**: Reaching Jerez is surprisingly easy. While thereâ€™s a small airport, taking the train is likely the simplest route, either from Madrid (\~4 hours) or Seville (\~1 hour).

**Getting Around**: The key bodegas (wineries) are in Jerez, SanlÃºcar de Barrameda, and El Puerto de Santa MarÃ­a. A convenient bus from Jerez (near the train station) goes to SanlÃºcar, and thereâ€™s a quick train to El Puerto. Iâ€™d advise against renting a carâ€”Sherry is fortified, and one tasting alone can be potent! Public transport is reliable, so thereâ€™s no need to drive.

**Arrival in Jerez**: We arrived in Jerez on a Sunday and stayed at a comfortable, reasonably priced accommodation booked through Booking. October wasnâ€™t crowded with tourists, and the weather was fantastic. The city is compact, very walkable, and filled with beautiful architecture. I wish I had more time to explore, but of course, the main goal was to drink Sherry!

The city is full of bars, particularly â€œtabancosâ€ (Sherry bars), where a glass ranges from 1â‚¬ to 5â‚¬. The quality is usually great, though there are occasional misses.

**Dining at La CarbonÃ¡**: On our first night, we had a reservation at La CarbonÃ¡ (https://maps.app.goo.gl/mJ411xqBpQS7KJ9X7), recommended by this subreddit. We chose the â€œLola CarbonÃ¡â€ tasting menu, which was 75â‚¬ per person and included 7 dishes paired with 7 different Sherries. Though there were some minor slip-ups (a shell in the seafood and limited English), the experience was a fantastic start to our trip.

**Exploring SanlÃºcar de Barrameda**: Early the next day, we took the bus to SanlÃºcar, a smaller seaside town with plenty of charm. Our first stop was Bodegas Hidalgo la Gitana (https://bodegashidalgolagitana.com/), which was incredible! The cathedral-like bodega building was awe-inspiring, and the tour was both informative and fun. For 19,50â‚¬, we tasted four Sherries, including two drawn directly from barrels with a traditional *venencia*. You even get to keep a branded glass as a memento. We left with a bottle of their Manzanilla Pastrana.

Afterward, we wandered to Bodegas ArgÃ¼eso (https://maps.app.goo.gl/YGtMGLEBheHYvbbP8) for a quick, free tasting in their shop. It was a good experience, though language was a bit of a barrier.

Our walk to Bodega Delgado Zuleta (https://maps.app.goo.gl/GXaJk9PvhGrDHRr29) led us to a pleasant surprise at Bodegas BarÃ³n (https://maps.app.goo.gl/zrCPuwmoGh5c84Vj9). Despite the language gap, the friendly staff gave us an impromptu tasting directly from the barrels. We ended up buying a bottle of their Manzanilla Pasada.

At Delgado Zuleta, we didnâ€™t have a reservation, but a kind staff member offered us a small free tasting. We sampled five or six different Sherries and bought a bottle of their Amontillado.

After a day full of tasting, we enjoyed a meal at Taberna der Guerrita (https://maps.app.goo.gl/qdwEh9vkcw4D6nuC6), another spot recommended here. The tapas were incredible, andâ€”perhaps inspired by all the Sherryâ€”we accidentally ordered bullâ€™s testicles! Also, be sure to check out their *trastienda*, a shop filled with Sherries.

**Sherry Museum at Bodegas Barbadillo**: We wrapped up SanlÃºcar with a stop at a small museum in Bodegas Barbadillo, which is worth a visit. Naturally, there was another tasting in the shop before we headed back to Jerez with five bottles in my backpack.

**Flamenco Night in Jerez**: That evening, we went to Tabanco El Pasaje (https://maps.app.goo.gl/WdU6Vhakca2TxiA4A) for a flamenco show. Although itâ€™s a popular tourist spot, the ambiance was great. We ordered a premium tapas set and enjoyed a house Amontillado that was so good we ordered another. The show itself was intense at first but very captivating.

**Touring the Iconic Bodegas**: The next morning, we visited Bodegas Lustau (https://lustau.es/en/) for a 30â‚¬ tour that included 7 Sherries (one VORS) and a vermouth. It was an amazing experience, and we bought a VORS bottle.

Later, we went to the renowned Bodega Tio Pepe (https://www.tiopepe.com/es-es/reserva). While the 24,90â‚¬ tour (4 Sherries included) was enjoyable, it felt a bit commercial with amusements like ""Sherry train ride.""

**Bodegas TradiciÃ³n**: Our final day began at Bodegas TradiciÃ³n (https://bodegastradicion.es/), which was absolutely outstanding. We received a private tour (as we were the only guests that day) with Ãgueda, who adapted her guidance to our deeper knowledge of Sherry. Afterward, we explored the ownerâ€™s private art collection, featuring Spanish masterpieces by artists like El Greco, VelÃ¡zquez or Goya. The tasting included two VOS, three VORS, and one Fino, all truly exceptional. This premium experience costs 55â‚¬ per person but is absolutely worth it.

**Final Stops**: Our last stop was Bodegas Fundador (https://brandyfundador.com/visita-bodega/), a large-scale bodega with a 30â‚¬ tour featuring three VORS. Afterward, we visited Vinos y Licores La Estrella (https://maps.app.goo.gl/aSXtcEMo37nSkkkr7) for a few final bottles before attempting a visit to the Consejo Regulador (https://maps.app.goo.gl/T7bcD9ZfdCJCZUh58), which, unfortunately, was closed during declared opening hours.

**Final Thoughts**: My trip to Jerez was unforgettable, and Iâ€™ll definitely be backâ€”maybe even next year. The region and its wines seem vastly underrated, which keeps prices affordable. And I still need to explore El Puerto!

**Bonus Tips**: If youâ€™re nearby, consider visiting Cadiz (a short train ride) and Seville. In Cadiz, GorriÃ³n (https://maps.app.goo.gl/NKt4MntEayq4EUfV7) is a great wine bar, while Baco Vinos (https://maps.app.goo.gl/mVEAHMfmXMtF8b3A8) is a well-stocked shop with English-speaking staff. Taberna La Manzanilla (https://maps.app.goo.gl/K9g5NUCgbu8VtzGj9) serves exclusively Sherries, many aged to VOS or VORS but declassified. In Seville, Vinoteca Lama La Uva (https://maps.app.goo.gl/55yxN3KHdSAu3o137) has an excellent selection and very kind, English-speaking owner, and Bar Casa Morales (https://maps.app.goo.gl/uxGHgZuVVxHSjUhQA) offers affordable, authentic, delicious experiences (the secret to get inside is to try all three different entrances).

Cheers, folks! Enjoy your Sherryâ€”not only this week!

Balade oenologique tasting package,10,1gjndkh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gjndkh,2,2024-11-05 02:49:17,"This is a tasting package of samples of BIO French wines. It's a blind tasting, you can read what you drank afterwards and they also provide tasting notes in French(see last images). I wrote my tasting notes before reading theirs, seems like for some of them we agreed for others not so much :) . First wine is no. 2, I forgot to take a picture of wine 1, it looked pretty similar to no 2 if a bit lighter maybe.

Wine 1
Sweet, apricot smell on the nose, as well as a bit of yeasty character and floral notes.
On the palate, quite acidic, and somewhat fruity, citrus with a bit of pear and apricot. Yeasty character persists on the palate.
Finish is more yeasty than anything else, lingering for a bit.

Wine 2
On the nose, pretty fruity, I think peach, yeasty notes here as well. The fruit persists on the palate, with a bit of a subtle thyme and oregano note going on as well, with the yeasty character here too. It also reminds me a bit of maybe a very fresh fruit tart? I don't know how to put it better. Quite savory, the finish is somewhat short. An interesting wine

Wine 3
A rose wine. On the nose, I'm honestly not getting much except for a slight floral note. On the palate, it's fruity, maybe some sort of red forest fruit, but again somewhat faint. The finish is surprisingly long and powerful, much more clear redcurrant than when you just taste it first. 

Wine 4
The first red wine. This is a light red wine, with musky and floral notes on the nose. Quite acidic, with light tannins. Body is thin. Definitely looks like Pinot Noir. I'm getting notes of cherry, plum and some almost tomato like savory note. In enjoyed this wine.

Wine 5

A much more corpolent red wine. On the nose, forest floor and redcurrant. Moderate acidity and tannins. Quite pleasant, easy-drinking but still somewhat powerful. I'm getting redcurrant and just berries in general. A bit of dried plum as well, especially on the finish. Finish is quite prolonged. 

Wine 6

A dark red wine. Pretty strong eucalyptus on the nose. Besides that, I'm also getting an almost cherry cola like note on the nose. Moderate acidity and somewhat strong tannins. The eucalyptus persists on the palate, being however complemented by cherry as well as dark fruit notes, such as blackcurrant and I think blackberry. Quite savory, long finish. Quite a complex wine, I really enjoyed this one.

"Have you ever advised, inserted yourself, or helped out an aging person with their wine collection?",4,1gjp4q4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gjp4q4/have_you_ever_advised_inserted_yourself_or_helped/,10,2024-11-05 04:00:37,"TL;DR - have you advised or helped out any aging wine collector population on the need to ""move"" wines, drink them, or get rid of stuff before it ages out? Even my healthy and hip Dad at 80 has a collection that isn't moving as fast, and I suspect we're seeing stuff die, and I feel like I should involve myself a bit.

\---------

I've worked my whole career in food and beverage in kitchens and front of house, then rooms ops and hospitality, eventually leading to design/build stuff, all since 1995. I've seen builds and helped with some wine rooms, in ideal and not so ideal situations. Then you move on... and old school inventory control still meant directors would ignore / miss some wine, or not sell it so it ages out and is no longer good. That's a bummer. It wasn't under my management, but I've seen some pretty stellar wine inventories get into disarray. It breaks your heart to see stuff turn or get ignored.

That being said, I notice baby boomers are both not traveling, nor eating or drinking, like they used to. Their cellars are full, and it's part of the ding the industry is having in re-inventing, modernizing, reaching new audiences, and competing with this temperance movement, weed, and interest in seltzers (the new Zima, Bartles and James, Smirnoff Ice, and this too shall pass). But they can't rely on boomers to buy, with as full as some of those cellars are!

But I do think there are a lot of personal collections that are turning. I mean, I'm 48 and I'm shocked what the pandemic did to my brain and time... I keep thinking a bunch of my collection is just 3 to 5 years old, and all of a sudden it's 15 years old, etc. So I realize there's a bunch of baby boomer collections that aren't being drunk as rapidly, and there are absolutely a bunch of cellars all over the world that just has turning or dead wines, and I want to know if any of you have done anything to prevent that?

I don't mean pilfering or self-interest, but have any of you helped a parent or friend by auditing a collection and sort of organizing what should be drunk or at least considered before it expires? How'd it go? 

I think this question might be extremely silly, so I might delete. Just curious if people have started seeing wine collections get ignored, sort of abandoned, and good stuff turning over time. Cheers all.

2020 Sauvion Vouvray | More delicious $15 Chenin Blanc ,41,1givkes,https://i.redd.it/bynw0wqerqyd1.jpeg,5,2024-11-04 02:53:11,"Ah, Chenin Blanc from the Loire. My go-to reliable whites for casual drinking. I can never say no to a bottle when I'm out searching for more bottles, and at a comfortably priced $15 at my local wine shop, an easy purchase to try out a new producer. Stored at 45, popped and poured - to note, it's a screwcap! Sipped sans pairing on the first night, paired with grilled chicken and potatoes on day two.

On the nose, faint floral scents at the rim - honeysuckle and citrus blossom. Further in, familiar notes of grapefruit, lemon - surprisingly no stone fruit, as I would've expected - faint apple. The first night it smelled like an entry level Bordeaux Sauv Blanc (some melon waved hello) - but on day two, the scent was much more what I'm used to from the region. Strong citrus. 

On the palate, quite light - medium dry, so there is a tasty bit of sweetness. Not as much acidity as I would've hoped, a little restrained in that regard for my tastes. Also, at 12.5%, zero noticeable burn to speak of. In composition, a super easy drinker! Flavors of apples, lemon, lime - none of the nutty flavors I've grown to love in higher end examples of the appellation - very citrus dominant, like the nose. It's still in the mid 80s here in Florida, so a great white wine to enjoy chilled outside.

At the price point, I still favor Maison Darragon or Famille Bougrier, but it's still a good example of entry level Vouvray - refreshing and tasty. Recommended! "

Another producer from that region Filipa Pato, also recommanded.

Proud of their region, local grapes. 10 euro a glass at the bar, i guess 20-25 euro a bottle local price. 

So much flavour and freshness at the same time, low alcohol due to the atlantic ocean. 

WOW, also the same in Germany, France and Italy. Be authentic and dont mess around too much, wine without makeup is the slogan from Filipa Pato.

I was only in Portugal for 4 days, but it will get a more prominent place in my wine cellar."

I also don't think I've ever watched a movie with two main characters who were so unlikeable with 2 hours of just lying to everyone about everything. Maybe because I didn't see it new, that I missed the cultural zeitgeist that this movie did to Pinot and SBC wine country?

Kirkland 2023 Russian River Valley Pinot Noir,2,1gj5mdu,https://i.redd.it/6wney2a95tyd1.jpeg,5,2024-11-04 10:54:25,"Being relatively new to Costco, the idea of a serviceable weekday pinot noir (from the RRV AVA no less) for only $12 seemed intriguing.

Itâ€™s not as good as I hoped it would be, however, it managed to beat out the Belle Glos I reviewed a few days ago. Anywayâ€¦.

A little sweet for a pinot, and slightly heavier in mouthfeel than average, but for $12 itâ€™s not unbearably so. Itâ€™s just enough to remind you that youâ€™re drinking a mass produced pinot where some corners have been cut, and some liberties taken.

This is all red fruit, with cherry, raspberry, and strawberry. No dark fruit here to really speak of. Immediately following is the earthy notes of oak, smoke, and leather. Normally tasting notes of smoke and leather in wine is something that I absolutely love, but the residual sugar, vanilla, and heavier mouthfeel cloud over it all. Medium to medium-high acidity, although the slightly heavier mouthfeel impacts the versatility. 

Not bad, but also not something Iâ€™d buy as a weekday staple. This is a wine you bring to a party as an afterthought. I would drink this if served it, but this will remain a house party ice bucket bottle. 

My current weekday pinot staple remains Pacific Redwoodâ€™s Organic Pinot. At only $17 per bottle, Iâ€™ll gladly pay that small premium to get a much better product, even if it is usually a bitch to find.

On the palate, brioche, green apple, mandarin, lemon peel, lime cordial, with a bit of flinty minerals on the finish which is very long.

Deep copper in color, slight cloudiness and small amount of sediment.

This is an inexpensive bottle so not expecting anything on the palate.  On the label, it says they ""made using only the highest quality Pinot Noir grapes"", ""delicate salmon colour"" from maceration, ""intense peach watermelon and candyfloss flavours"".

Oxidation, med amber. I see some viscosity as well.
I pick up dried orange slices, dried dates, mushrooms and cedar.
On palate, I want to say old strawberry jam, ginseng, and cinnamon.
Intensity I would have to say low+, low acidity, offdry, short.

I kept it in a small decanter to see if it developed any further, but nothing other than increase in acidity.  Before turning into vinegar, I made into a reduction to top on vanilla ice cream.

Advice: M. Chapoutier Condrieu Schistes d'Agrumes,2,1gj1m83,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gj1m83/advice_m_chapoutier_condrieu_schistes_dagrumes/,7,2024-11-04 07:23:30,"Just wanted to ask for a bit of advice. A liquor store has the wine in the title (2021), which is normally â‚¬42, but is now on discount to â‚¬31.50. It's still a bit of a high price for what I usually want to spend, but I'm willing to spend it on something I think I'll enjoy (e.g. last week I picked up a 2007 Colheita port from Dow's for a similar price that I'm thoroughly enjoying).

I'll explain my tastes so that you have more information to recommend buying/not buying a bottle. I tend to far prefer fortified wine, port especially, but I'm currently in the process of learning more about wine since I want to explore the wine world. I tend to prefer white wine over red. I (somewhat) like chardonnay, but am not a big fan of sauvignon blanc. In terms of red, the ones I like the most are pinotage and shiraz, but don't really like cabernet sauvignon. I also like procescco.

I received a hearty recommendation for Chapoutier from someone I know that very much enjoys wine, and tried a bit of pinot noir from Chapoutier, which was pretty good. That's why I'm considering this bottle. I also bought a bottle of CÃ´tes du Rhone and CÃ´tes du Rhone Blanc from Chapoutier, but those two won't be opened for now (since there are several open bottles that need to be finished first), meaning I don't have a base point of comparison.

Would you guys recommend buying the bottle? Sorry if it's quite a lot of text for what might be an easy yes or no for you, but I'm curious about the wine and don't want to potentially waste my money."

Best QPR in Piedmont?,105,1gid2u7,https://i.redd.it/pimtpk5zllyd1.jpeg,67,2024-11-03 09:33:50,"Reposting because original was removed. 

These are becoming my two go-to Barolos for highest QPR. The Vajra I feel is pretty commonly suggested to punch higher than the price. The Vietti is a staple producer and is hard to go wrong. For between $35-$45 itâ€™s hard to beat this. 

Do you have any suggestions that you feel are better for high QPR in this region?

Notes: I had these both earlier today so I have to  off memory so my post doesnâ€™t get removed. 

Vajra: classic brick Barolo color, bright red cherry, rose, tar, slight licorice. Medium high tannin, medium high acidity. Lots of fresh red fruit, well balanced. 92.

Vietti: Slightly more ruby than brick. Also lots of bright red fruit, tar, almost a meaty scent as well to it. Extremely smooth tannins balanced with a bright acidity. Well balanced and potential to cellar. 93. 

The 2020 year so far is close to 2019. Seriously a great vintage so far, lots of depth and potential to cellar. Still very young but the Barbarescoâ€™s and Langhe Neb are drinking beautifully now.  "

Firm texture I expect of Beaune with forest floor, dried flowers and a hint of barnyard all playing second fiddle to black cherries, macerated strawberries and raspberry notes. All bursting from the glass. Palate is also a mouthful of ripe red fruits with whispers of earth, flowers and spice. Finish is not incredibly long but sufficient to warrant this 1er cru's reputation. After about an hour in the glass, tertiary notes begin to take over and the age shows. The fruit doesn't disappear but it steps into the background for all the earthy funky floral notes to pop out. Onto the Sancerre Rouge. Obviously more a contrast than comparison but wow what a difference! Smoky, dark and brooding. My fiancÃ©, who's notes I love, said it smells like a pirate. Big, big nose wafting out of the glass. Blackberries and cassis, aforementioned smoke, baking spices. Almost smells more Rhone than Loire. Same on the palate. Full bodied, silky tannins, well balanced overall. Ripe fruit, complex secondary notes, long finish. Cheaper than the Burgundy, too. (I suppose that's a given these days.) Both paired quite nicely with Chinese food. (Pinot and Chinese is one of my go-to's.) Cheers!"

Napa Sauv. blanc - help me understand (and possibly help my marriage),13,1ghvs5y,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1ghvs5y/napa_sauv_blanc_help_me_understand_and_possibly/,41,2024-11-02 19:54:58,"Hello!

My wife and I made a trip through Napa valley this summer (first time!) and went to St. Supery based on a recommendation from a friend.  They are well known for their sauvignon blancs, which are spectacular.  We liked their wines so much we joined their club even though we're on the east coast.  We have not EVER joined a club before, so that's how much we liked their stuff.

Fast forward a bit, and we have received a few shipments.  One of these wines - specifically [this one](https://www.stsupery.com/product/2023-rutherford-estate-vineyard-sauvignon-blanc/) \- is causing a disagreement between us.  While the taste is still wonderful, the wine has a strong, pungent, wet wool, dirty sock smell.  It his me in the face...this is not a subtle note.  But, my wife doesn't smell it at all, and thinks I'm nuts.  Usually she's the one that's able to identify flavors and notes more than me, so this is surprising.  This has happened with two different bottles form two different shipments, so I don't think it's related to an anomaly in storage, cork, etc.

I have a few questions for the experts here:

1 - Is this smell unique to the one drinking?  Is this sort of a cilantro/soap situation where I can smell the odor, but my wife is unable?

2 - what can cause this odor?  I've read a few articles that cite the reason as either lightstrike due to improper storage, chemical contamination, or bad yeast.  But, this is above my paygrade to answer.  I can say that we store all the bottles in a medium size, temp controlled wine fridge in our basement.

3 - is this an intended characteristic of the wine?  We've tried a few of the St. Supery Sauvignon Blancs and the Rutherford Estate is the only one that seems to carry this particular nose.

Would love to hear thoughts from you all!

Is Franzia going under?,0,1gigii0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gigii0/is_franzia_going_under/,10,2024-11-03 13:05:49,"Been drinking the stuff for years now as my regular cheapo table wine (only reds) My favorites were ""Dark red blend"" and ""Burgundy"" Id sometimes buy there merlot or cab when the others weren't around. 

However, my ""totalwine"" store along with several grocery stores our suddenly out of stock on the blend and burgundy versions. 

I know its seasonal and the good and bad years effect the tastes over the years. But to be sold out completely? I recently read some wine article mentioning people are buying less mass market wines and this has effected its sales along with the growers in California.

I can only assume that this is a cut cost solution by reducing its products and probably phasing out certain brand styles.

Am I wrong here or did some catastrophe happen agriculturely? Just wondering."

The nose absolutely exploded from the glass with autumn leaves, spice, a hint of burg funk & really well integrated stems. The fruit character is really where the complexity comes around, this bounced between ripe cherries, black cherries, cranberries & raspberries all in various forms.. think luxardo cherries then immediately to ripe cherries etc. The palate comes across slightly thin with the acid seemingly carrying the structure. Overall gorgeous, elegant & understated but Iâ€™m not sure I see this going the distance. "

Dried figs, dark cherries and blackberries, with pleasant notes of undergrowth and mushroom. Quite advanced for 2018 and reflected the warm vintage.

Sweet oak, violets, brambly fruit on the nose. On the palate sour cherries, strawberries, cranberries. Vibrant, zippy acidity with a spicy finish. Exuberant, youthful and beautifully balanced.

Right now, Iâ€™m drinking Firestone Vineyard Merlot and my mouth immediately got itchy. I looked up the ingredients, and sure enough â€” hint of raspberries. After all the research Iâ€™ve done, Iâ€™m still confusedâ€¦

Are there actual berries in red wine, or is the make up of the grape (or grape skin?!) the same enzymes as a raspberry? Enlighten me, please! Make it make sense! I love red wine :("

Open Your Wine Autumn - September and October roundup,16,1ghf6wl,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1ghf6wl/open_your_wine_autumn_september_and_october/,1,2024-11-02 03:33:43,"Some of you may have read my previous post on this topic, but for those of you just tuning in, Open Your Wine Autumn is a new tradition I have inaugurated which is exactly what it sounds like: A season-long excuse to open any wine that needs an excuse for opening, a yearly cure to the plague of ""waiting for a special occasion"" to crack that nice bottle you're sitting on for no compelling reason. As autumn calls to mind the natural cycles of aging and death, the wise wino, never taking life, health, or time for granted, knows to drink up while they still have the chance. Or, to put things in a slightly more grounded way: I get really bored of only ever opening 'responsible' weeknight bottles ad infinitum when I know I've got more exciting stuff sitting in my fridge, and I want to go a little apeshit for going apeshit's sake from time to time.

To that end I have put my modest amount of money where my mouth is and opened a few of the nicer bottles in my collection since September. I've done this on random weeknights, I've had them with burgers and shawarma and Popeye's and Chinese take-out, and I've consumed every one of them on my living room couch, mostly in pajamas. Since I've got until December 21st to keep #OYWA up I've not yet escalated to the bottles I've been most precious about (stay tuned for the December roundup for those), but I have dusted off the far reaches of my wine fridge and cleared out a good number of lovely bottles which had been waiting patiently for anywhere from 1-3 years for me to get around to drinking them.

In no particular order, here is the most recent batch of the wines I have opened so far this autumn in the spirit of OYWA:

\---

Alessandra Divella Dosaggio Zero Rose de Saignee NV - This stuff was incredible, I love good Franciacorta and having really enjoyed Divella's 'NiNi' at the Four Horsemen a year or two ago I was very excited to find another of her zero-dosage wines at a local shop. I didn't take very detailed notes on this ('strawberry' and 'yeast', ok, very helpful, past me) but with a bit of air on it it went from deceptively simple to absolutely screaming with flavor and aroma that'd make any grand cru grower champagne jealous. Not sure what the hell I meant by ""almost carnal"" but that's in my notes too? Fascinating color, a kind of rusty pinkish sultana raisin hue. World class Franciacorta, will be an insta-buy if I ever come across it again. This stuff begs to be paired with a meal; I think I had mine with fried chicken?

Catherine & Pierre Breton 'Les Perrieres' Bourguiel 2015 - This was a slightly shy Cab Franc that really wanted some time in a decanter to start expressing itself, but an absolute pleasure to drink once it did. Serious depth of flavor with your typical herby-peppery raspberry and earth accord, structured but easy drinking (""digestible"" if you like) at the same time. Had it with a burger and mac salad and could not have asked for a better pairing.

Chateau Simone Palette Rouge 2009 - Had been seeing this gathering dust for ages at a local shop and I'm glad I rescued it. One of those interesting southern French blends, mostly Grenache and Mourvedre with a whole hodgepodge of supporting grapes. Reminded me a bit of a Bordeaux at first with its strong red fruit-mineral-leather thing it had going on, but with sufficient air and warmth it started showing really interesting eucalyptus and licorice and garrigue notes. Really beautiful at 15 years and seemed like it would only get better with more age.

Olivier Horiot ""En Valingrain"" Rose des Riceys 2018 - I had the En Barmont a little earlier this year and loved it, and I liked this one even better. Fascinatingly 'textural' Pinot Noir, it has this kind of mercurial combination of density and lightness I find very hard to put into words; at the risk of getting too silly here it has a certain mysterious, magical energy and otherworldly tension to it. In any case I could drink a pail of the stuff; very tasty strawberry and sour cherry notes, herbaceous, a touch of cedar or pencil shavings. Really cool dark ruby color too, the kind of wine you want to look at with a flashlight. If those red health potions you drink in video games were real, this is what drinking one would feel like.

Domaine de l'Enclos Chablis GC 'Vaudesir' 2020 - One of my favorite white wines I've had all year, the kind of Chardonnay that just puts a smile on my face. I was enjoying myself too much to take detailed notes (I recall lemon, mineral, and smoke) but I did note that it was both serious and deep enough I wanted to take my time with it and also delicious and refreshing enough I wanted to neck a liter of it and ask for seconds.

Domaine de la Chevalerie Grand-Mont Bourguiel 2015 - I enjoyed this, although after having sat on it for nearly 3 years I was left wondering why I waited so long as it didn't really feel all that momentous. (That's the benefit of OYWA, I guess.) Interesting lychee black tea and barnyard notes which I find typical of this kind of low-intervention Loire Cab Franc, a bit of spice, raspberry, leather, plum, a bit of earth. Deep purplish-garnet color. If you've had Chevalerie's other offerings you can imagine a somewhat more structured, ageworthy version of those and you'll know exactly what you're in for with this."

I donâ€™t drink much Napa, so I was truly shocked at how heavy bodied and just generally BIG this was. I adore Chinon and CFs from Finger Lakes, so this really threw me off at first sip. In my mind CF is thin, light bodied. This could have passed for a zin or MourvÃ¨dre. Bone dry, high, grippy tannins. Light plum and current on the nose. Biggest flavors were leather, tobacco, dry leaves (maybe the Pennsylvania fall affected my taste buds). Each pour I enjoyed more than the previous. A lovely wine, biggest issue was how it tasted against my expectations, but no issues on its own. A nice drinking experience and it was fun to branch out and just enjoy being surprised by something. âœŒðŸ¼"

Now Iâ€™ve seen from this subreddit that some wines get better with age and others will just stay the same or degrade and that it totally depends on the wine. Will leaving a Madeira wine to sit for a long time make the flavour better? Or will it just remain virtually the same in all those years?

Also Iâ€™ve read they should be stored upright? Is this correct?"

Review: Belle Glos Clark & Telephone Pinot Noir,95,1ggsgoa,https://i.redd.it/q7t2w7efi6yd1.jpeg,56,2024-11-01 06:47:15,"Soâ€¦this says pinot noir on the bottle, but this does *not* taste like pinot noir. This tastes over-extracted and is syrupy in body/mouthfeel. Dark purple in color, much darker than a pinot noir should be. Needless to say, I can immediately tell this is heavily manipulated like Prisoner and Caymus.

Heavy notes of sweet vanilla, and oak thatâ€™s of an unnatural character. The fruit is a non-distinct mix of mostly dark and some red. I can make out lots of blackberry,  and some cherry and smoke.

This is neither elegant or structured. I would honestly look elsewhere for a quality pinot. It doesnâ€™t even taste that good generally. 

This ainâ€™t it. "

Med golden colour

Nose: lots of lees-y, almost champagne-like brioche notes, citrus, and vanilla

Palate: very concentrated, expressive citrus notes (orange peel, lemon), well integrated oak (vanilla, lees characteristics), minerals, very long finish

Beautiful freshness really helps balance out the high alcohol (15%) and oak notes, gives it energy and acidic grip that melts into a long, waxy finish. Not usually a fan of big oaky whites, but that was very moreish. 

Got it on clearance and sad I didnâ€™t get everything they had.

Your favorite Aglianicos,3,1gh7yi1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gh7yi1/your_favorite_aglianicos/,6,2024-11-01 22:23:31,"So I recently got back from a trip to Italy, we were lucky enough to visit Rome and Naples and I made it a point to try some local wines. In my first couple days in Campania I had tried a Taurasi Reserva and another Aglianico and noticed both had a sort of bitter taste or bitter finish that I wasn't enjoying. On a trip out to Amalfi Coast we stopped at Ettori Sammarco, a small winery right on the coast in Ravello. Which I highly recommend stopping in if you're in the area. Very family feel, they have a little tasting counter in the winery and the founder/owner was right there overseeing the work and chatting with us. I believe he is 92 and still involved!I tried some delicious whites and some of their reds and fell in love with their reserve that is 70% Aglianico, 30% Pie de Rosso. It had none of the bitterness and everything I loved about the other wines I had tried. Talking with the host and the owner they mentioned there are multiple types of Aglianicos and the terroir of Ravello is part of why their wines don't have the same bitterness as others. 


I brought some bottles back that I'll sit on for a bit but I'm looking for other recommendations of Aglianicos that don't have that bitter note. As much as I'd love to order direct from Sammarco, ordering by the case with international shipping isn't in my budget at the moment (maybe as a treat down the road). I also get the feeling the other Aglianicos I tried may have been too young and those bitter notes may mellow out of the years. So I'm not opposed to grabbing some bottles to set aside. "

"Wine ""weep"" holes?",1,1gh8rwm,https://i.redd.it/dz00ekkqbbyd1.jpeg,20,2024-11-01 22:58:39,So in the process of moving and unpacking I saw two of my 10yr old mount peak bottles were leaking.

"Help Me Decide: E. Guigal ChÃ¢teau d'Ampuis & Bellefont-Belcier Saint-Ã‰milion Grand Cru, or a single bottle of E. Guigal Ex Voto Ermitage Blanc?",3,1gh1ryq,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gh1ryq/help_me_decide_e_guigal_chÃ¢teau_dampuis/,4,2024-11-01 16:55:53,"Get a combo consisting of E. Guigal ChÃ¢teau d'Ampuis & Bellefont-Belcier Saint-Ã‰milion Grand Cru or a single bottle of  Guigal Ex Voto Ermitage Blanc?

I've been thinking about what to go with (I havenâ€™t had any of them before). Iâ€™m fairly confident about enjoying the reds; Iâ€™ve had Saint-Ã‰milion in a similar price range in the past, and while I liked it, it didnâ€™t leave a lasting impression (so maybe skip? save some money). Iâ€™ve never had a CÃ´te-RÃ´tie, though Iâ€™ve heard excellent things, and I know ChÃ¢teau d'Ampuis has a solid reputation. Iâ€™ve enjoyed Syrah based wines before, so I feel like it could be a good fit.

As for the white, Iâ€™m less familiar with white wines in general but have been intrigued ever since Konstantin Baum introduced the 2012 Ex Voto in one of his videos. The bottle available isnâ€™t a 2012, but Iâ€™m still curious to try it and have high expectations.

Sadly at the moment I don't have any information about vintages, but I expect them to be fairly young ones (towards latest releases if not the latests). It might also be important to mention I don't really plan on aging any of them, might not drink them when they come but soon enough.

So... what do you guys think? What would you go with?"
Salwey Oberrotweil Weissburgunder 2020,15,1ggpv0k,https://i.redd.it/6j147b8xv5yd1.jpeg,1,2024-11-01 04:41:09,"This Salwey Weissburgunder is an amazing expression of the volcanic soils and mineral-rich terroir of the Baden region. 

The aroma immediately captivates with a cozy campfire-among-flints essence. The elegant smokyness is balanced by lighter, fresher notes reminiscent of lemon zest and wildflowers, creating a cool tension between rugged and delicate aromas. 
On the palate, it has a beautiful unctuous texture like buttermilk floral honey but still with a bright and vibrant acidity and crisp minerality. 
It paired reallt nicely with creamy oysters and grilled lobster on butter-soaked bread. 
I found this wine really interesting and special and I canâ€™t stop thinking about it. I think Iâ€™m in love. "

I'm hosting a Burgundy-themed wine evening tomorrow, and I'm curious as to people's thoughts on whether I should decant the reds.

When I've previously hosted wine evenings, I tend to double-decant the reds a couple of hours beforehand, especially younger reds, to allow them to open up a bit. However, I've got a couple of older wines this time and I'm not certain if I should double decant them. 

Below is my selection of reds from across the CÃ´te de Beaune, CÃ´te Chalonnaise, and CÃ´te de Nuits (in serving order):

* Domaine Denis Carre Bourgogne Hautes CÃ´te de Beaune 2019,
* Moillard Volnay 1er Cru â€˜Les Santenotsâ€™ 2011,
* ChÃ¢teau De Pommard Clos Marey-Monge Monopole 2014,Â

This was utter deliciously but what impressed me the most was its elegance  and balance.

I donâ€™t think traditional tasting notes work for these wines, Iâ€™d have to tell you about the wildly high volatile acidity on the red and the almost too much texture on the white and we would fixate on that and never get to the important part. 

These are emotional wines, thereâ€™s not many producers that can make you feel as much in a wine as Kenjiro does, that doesnâ€™t mean the wines are easy by any means, I think most people would be surprised and probably not understand if they saw just how much VA is in the wines but then you taste them and the only reaction is to smile.

I am in BA for another day based in Palermo. Which wine shop is known for the best prices? I would like to buy something premium like Chacra or Zapata Argentina, but the prices vary quite a bit amongst the local wine shops and I am not sure what a good price is. Perhaps there is a supermarket that sells wine for good prices?

Oddly, many of the prices make it more expensive to buy the wine here in Argentina than imported back in Australia.

Nice nose with fresh fruits and a bit of cherry.  Too harsh on the first sips.  It needs some decanting but it did soften as I drank a glass over 30 minutes.  I usually drink a bottle over a few days, so I expect it to get better.  Light bodied, red fruits, a bit of leather maybe and wood.  Fairly short finish with not a lot of complexity.  Not terribly well balanced.  For $20, itâ€™s not bad.  Iâ€™ve only had a handful of Barolos but they were properly aged.  I donâ€™t know enough yet to determine how good a wine would be after a few years in the cellar, this one might be a little better, but I donâ€™t think it will ever be fantastic.

I just turned 21 the other day and to mark my ability to legally purchase a bottle of wine I plan on buying a nice bottle of Bordeaux. I have done a ton of research over the past few months about wine, especially Bordeaux. I'm also pretty familiar with wine because my dad is in the wine business. If I'm being honest though, I'm just starting to appreciate wine, and I don't quite know yet what my personal preferences are. With that being said I want to buy a bottle of Bordeaux to start my cellar with. I narrowed my search down to 2 wines 2020 Figeac or 2020 Chateau Ducru-Beaucaillou. If I am going with rankings, WA gave the Figeac 100 points (My dad says WA is the best ranking followed by WS). On the other hand, I think the Ducru Beaucaillou is a little more elegant which I think is more my style(I just don't know yet for sure though). Another major criteria I have is which wine will be ready first. I would like to drink these wines within the decade. Does anyone have any thoughts? I do plan on buying a few other cheaper wines to get started but I wanted a nice bottle to store. Sorry for the long post I just don't know what direction I should go.

Neighbors came over to celebrate my husbandâ€™s birthday, brought dessert, and I suggested this as the night we open the very old wine. And it wasâ€¦.

Not as bad as we expected! Not as good as we remembered, but it was drinkable. 

Still had faint traces of the apricot, peach, and pear we remembered. Lost the florals. Had some port-like notes. Not terrible for a 24-year old wine! Hats off to the winemaker. ðŸŽ©

And it was fun remembering our trip to Monterey and San Francisco all those years ago when we were newly dating. "

I have roughly 40 bottles of wine, nothing insanely valuable, but some gems from Heitz, Dunn, etc from 2012-14. All of it is high-quality California or Oregon red wine that I hope to open in 5-20 years.

My fiancÃ© and I moved out of Denver this summer and left the wine in thermal fridge tote bags underneath a friends bed where itâ€™s roughly 69-71Â° in perpetuity and in the dark. We moved to Austin, and the moving company wouldnâ€™t take the wine. 

1) what damage is being done to the wine at that temperature? Itâ€™s been there three months. It is a mix of Pinot Noir and Cab Sauv
2) what is the most economical and safe way to get the wine to Texas?

The whole collection might be worth $5,000-7,000 - I am not really interested in high-end wine shipping, but I donâ€™t want to fly up to Colorado and rent a car to bring it down to Texas. I am considering securely packing it up and checking it on a United flight across 3-4 boxes. I am confident that a â€œfragileâ€ sticker and proper packing would ensure its safety on the plane to about 99%. I could also just tough it out and rent a car one-way and make the drive, costing me probably $600 in plane, gas, and car rental.

I thought this was just an American thing that by imports/marketing Riesling has a reputation of being â€œsweetâ€. But even in Europe, people also seem to have this perspective in my experience.

With spicy Indian food you say, how inappropriate. This was only used during early appetizers, and have to say the spices counterintuitively did not overwhelm the wines.

I am relatively new to wine and havenâ€™t developed great vocabulary for what I am tasting, but I loved how â€˜crispâ€™ the Gramercy Cellars was but still had a depth of darker fruit almost savory taste was. The Unnamed Series was great because it felt like over the course of the evening like I was drinking 3 separate wines. When I first opened it it had the same crispness I liked in the Gramercy bottle, but then changed to an almost smoky flavor. After about another hour the smoke gave way to a really delicious funky fruity wine. Really great stuff. 

All of this has made me extremely curious about other Walla Walla producers. My first question is: in my researching these bottles I have noticed people say rocks Syrah has a distinct funk. I am assuming thatâ€™s what I liked in the second bottle. Do other grapes besides Syrah exhibit this funky flavor from Rocks producers? My second question is i am looking for recommendations for wines similar to the ones i described.

2018 V12 Cabernet Sauvignon

Pulled and poured

Super rich jam, tobacco and a bit of dustiness on the nose initially, florals breaking through after 30-45 minutes in the glass

On the palate itâ€™s a bit muted to start, thereâ€™s some blackberry, tart cherries and some vanilla. Tannins are polished, plenty of acid here (probably from the hillside elevations of the vineyard) but not overwhelming, finish is long with toasty oak and spices, paired well with some Japanese bbq marinated flap loin cooked on the grill."

How do I get into learning about red wine?,1,1gduusy,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gduusy/how_do_i_get_into_learning_about_red_wine/,9,2024-10-28 12:32:26,"Hello wine community.
Over the last year or so, Iâ€™ve really gotten into liking wines, reading about them and tasting them - but only whites. Mainly because I prefer whites, but also because I have an easier time distinguishing notes and differentiating the wines. I especially find Rieslings interesting, as the wines are incredibly versatile (I love crisp Riesling from Mosel, especially ones only harvested and made 1-2 years ago). NZ Sauvignons are also a favorite of mine (I prefer crisp, acidic, fruity and dry whites.) 

But reds just seem so much more difficult and hard to grasp? Where do I start? What grapes/areas? Also the notes and palates - for some reason I just do not find it as easy as smelling/tasting them on whites. How do I get going? 

I do drink reds - and like them - but the knowledge is very basic (I know I like Pinots). 

What would your tip be? How do I get good at reds. Thanks! ðŸ·"

I only visit this subreddit and donâ€™t really know where else to post this, and this is something I am really struggling with.

Â 

I come from an environment where drinking is considered normal. This goes for not just my family, but basically everyone I grew up with. Parents of friends down the street, social gatherings like birthdays, diner parties. Ever since I was a kid, almost all the adults in my life drank alcohol. A considerable portion of the friends I have now, also like to drink. Not all are heavy drinkers, but if I am being honest it feels like I am verging on the edge of alcoholism myself and I know for a fact both my parents are and have been alcoholics for a long time.

Â 

What â€˜kept me in the darkâ€™ for a long time is that no-one around me really seemed to be compromised in their daily lives because of this life-style. Functioning addicts (not all of them, but still), so to speak. If I am being honest (again) I also donâ€™t see the problem in drinking whatever amount if itâ€™s someoneâ€™s choice and it doesnâ€™t come with harmful consequences for that person or his/her surroundings.

Â 

However, someone really close to me has developed a condition which really has damaged the way I view this person, and at time makes me want to cut him/her out of my life for good. Thus, the reason of this post.

Â 

Is it possible for some-one who has been drinking all his/her life to develop a sort of allergy of alcohol?

Â 

The person I am referring to may be having a pleasant conversation with you, but as soon as the first glass of wine is consumed things take a turn. The visual aspects of someone who is completely drunk are recognizable immediately (which is â€˜too soonâ€™) but even worse, the personâ€™s whole character seems to change. The same anecdotes are told back to back. Mean verbal jabs are made. His or her opinion on things are really extreme, but seem to be completely random, like the real â€˜he or sheâ€™ is completely gone.

Â 

It's just like the tolerance is completely gone, and a sort of super random auto-pilot takes over. I know it sounds like I am describing someone who is black-out drunk but like I said, this occurs after just one glass of wine, and this person has been drinking all his/her life. Can you drink away your tolerance to the point you are just a completely different person?"

So fresh and precise still this could go longer easily.

Triolet 2020 - Less salinity and complexity, this was a challenging vintage. Similar lemon and lime but also a little grassy yet a little brighter than the 2015. Citrus galore on the palate, however feels thinner and less complex. 

Triolet 2022 - The standout for the Triolet here, this one is so well integrated. Has complexity beyond the 2015 and also tastes older than the 2015. Zippy yet creamy and well balanced. 2022 is a great vintage.

Chardonnay 2020 - Buttery and rich on the nose, refreshing salinity and yellow fruits. Still great complexity for this challenging year. 

Chardonnay 2021 - Like the 2020 but more fresh, more acidity and more fruit forward. A buffed up version of the 2020.

Chardonnay 2022 - Okay so what a vintage for the whites this is, so complex and drinking well beyond its years. This is a standout and so well integrated already, this would be exciting to revisit in 10 years. 

Marli Russell 2021 - A new endeavour by Mount Mary focusing on Rhone varieties grown and vinified at the estate. Big red fruit nose, core of strawberry and jam, smells like a farmers market. The palate is light and fresh with strawberry, cranberry, light as a feather, wow! Young Grenache vines so itâ€™s less concentrated fruit and lacks the earthiness you expect from a GSM. 

Marli Russell 2022 - This one has darker fruits, jammy plum and boysenberry, very brooding on the nose. Palate similar to the 2021 but more concentrated fruits. 

Pinot Noir 2021 - Very excited, my favourite Australian Pinot, feels like its weightless on the nose, dark red fruit core, porcelain on the palate itâ€™s so delicate, floats effortlessly with a trio of strawberry, slight pepper and vanilla pods.

Quintet 2014 - Deep and concentrated, blackcurrant and boysenberry with dried vanilla pods. Dark and ripe red fruits converging on a medium body. 10 years on and could still go a long way! 

Quintet 2017 - More liquorice and pronounced red fruits compared to the 2014, I get a little eucalyptus too. This one could almost fool me as Margaret River in a blind tasting. 

Quintet 2021 - Lost the eucalyptus note entirely, more earthy with deep red fruits with much more concentration. Excellent balance, great oak and vanilla perfectly integrated.

Quintet 2022 - More vanilla pronounced, thinner body on the palate but fresh and vibrant still with ripe red fruits."

In the privileged position of being a semi-retired physician with time including for travel, and have some capital. I would become a wine ""professional"" just to do this. I'm banned by my luckily more-sensible wife from starting or investing in a hobby winery so what else could I do to work or contribute to the wine world? I currently help a friend in her warehouse winery as needed but it needs to be a real role (i.e. 20+ hours a week). I'm in Australia.

It doesn't have to make money. I doubt the world needs more amateur wine writers. Ideas I've had... I could go in as an investor if a friend with industry experience starts a wine bar. Non profit? I have lots of contacts in the Middle East and could do something somehow helping winemakers in marginal areas?? Doing boutique imports is probably the easiest to initiate from a mechanical point of view but sounds capital-intensive, low and possibly negative margin and generally a pain in the ass unless I actually tried to scale it up. Would involve tax-deductible travel and probably good home drinking in direct proportion to sales failure but I'm under no illusions as to the glamour (my father shipped industrial material around the world and it seemed very painful).

Any ideas?

First time trying old wine (Lafite 1988),135,1gckn96,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gckn96,40,2024-10-26 20:05:04,"Tried 3 different vintages of Lafite during the Decanter Masterclass in Singapore. 

2018 was very tight and tannic with primary fruits dominating both the aroma and palette. Can see how the wine will be elegant and great in the future. 

2008 was more advanced but still had great structure and started to show more softness but still had the primary fruit core. 

1988 was the one that made me go â€˜what the hell!?!?â€™ The first sniff I took almost made me gag. The barnyard funk was so strong that I thought I put my head into a pail of horse shit. Honestly, Iâ€™m not sure if this is representative of what older Bordeaux wines taste like. But it was quite revolting. The speaker remarked that we have to look past the barnyard funk to see the underlying tertiary notes. At this point, I was seriously questioning if the wine was corked or spoilt but it was my first time trying a 30+ yo wine and everyone around me didnâ€™t say anything so I didnâ€™t want to raise any questions lol. 

For those of you whoâ€™ve tried this vintage in recent years or have had experience with much older Bordeaux reds, is it common to have such a strong barnyard funk (smelling like horse shit)? Personally I didnâ€™t find it enjoyable so idk maybe itâ€™ll be something I have to experience more to appreciate. "

We are both fairly new to wine and haven't delved too much into the Old World. We loved how much we learned about the process and grew a much deeper love and respect for wine. 

The 1993 Vouvray, we only bought because that is our birth year and it was only 6â‚¬. It was the oldest white that I have had and it was a lot in the mouth. Tasted like I took a mouth full of dirt and chased it with some mushroom water. Definitely wasn't a favorite. 

We weren't in Bordeaux long, only 2 and a half days and only got one wine tour in at St. Emillion. I wish we would have been able to spend more time in this area as there was more things to see and wine to try than we had time for. 

This is the haul that we came home with. Our main goal was to get a bottle with the intention to save it for our 15 year anniversary. We chose the 2020 Chateau Martet. We loved this wine when we tried it at the shop. Had the tasting notes of dark cherry, vanilla, and licorice. 

Happy with our haul and can't wait to go back!"

Initially super strong and high tannins, but mellowed out and fruit notes came out.

Notes of cherry pits, raspberry, strawberry stems, aloe vera, green peppercorn, orange skin. 

Definitely a powerful wine, doesn't taste hot, but you can tell it's strong from an alcohol perspective.

Paired well with spicy vegetarian nachos. 

I love this wine, it's a tiny notch below the Shakti, but that may just be age. 

As a bonus, saved half a glass for the next day and it opened up even more! Would definitely decant for a minimum three hours before touching this.

Just wanted to share a few pics of the Port Capital of the World: Duoro. This place really needs to be seen to believed. The slopes that hold the port grape are steep and rock solid. Slate and Shist rock battle for the grape vines of Pedro Xemenez and many other varietals. The people of the Duoro are lovely, hard working, life long devotees of their task, climbing these rocky slopes with wine baskets to harvest these grapes. 

After touring most of the wineries, my favorites are Sandemans and Dow, but other smaller, less well-known producers are also fantastic. 

I cook with 10 year tawny (pork with red wine vinegar, safe and port are my go-to) and drink 20 and 30 year tawny.

This isn't likely to be super expensive stuff, and I'd be keeping things for around 5-10 years, not decades. As an example I recently bought 3 cases of Chateau Teyssier (Montagne St Emilion) 2019, at a cost of EUR12/bottle which I expect will improve over the next 5 years. 

I've previously dabbled with home-brewing beer, and ""made"" a temperature controlled fermentation chambre using a tried and tested DIY approach: a fridge, with a small 60W tubular electric heater placed inside, the fridge and heater both wired into a thermostatic controller which turns one or the other on to maintain the temp within a set range. For home-brew this was around 19-21 degrees C, but it would be easy to adjust this to say 12-15 degrees C.

I'm wondering if something like this would work rather than spending Â£100's on a purpose-build wine fridge (esp. given the type/value of wine I'd be storing).

A tad hot when we first opened it but the alcohol dissipated within 10 minutes to reveal softened tannins and notes of preserved plums, dark stone fruits, distressed leather and earth. It lifted the oily/fishiness of the bonito. Might have clashed with the sweetness of the onion but otherwise an ideal pairing.

Not enough BlaufrÃ¤nkisch around here....,140,1gc2o32,https://i.redd.it/lcukctttfywd1.jpeg,27,2024-10-26 02:34:17,"So it's time to change that! This beauty comes from the Eisenberg region of the southern Burgenland. Wachter-Wiesler are a well established producer from there, making BlaufrÃ¤nkisch in a terroir-driven style that focuses on refinement and freshness. The wine hails from the Weinberg vineyard in the village of Deutsch-SchÃ¼tzen. It has a souther exposition and its soil consists of iron rich clay. After spontaneous fermentation and spent 34 months in a large oak casks.

I aerated the wine for about 1 1/2 hours after opening and served it in a Spiegelau Definition Bordeaux glass. It has an opaque ruby colour and garnet rim.

On the nose the wine presents itself with dark fruity aromas at first, think of luxardo cherry, sloe and plum. Soon after, more savoury notes take control, hallmark notes of Eisenberg BlaufrÃ¤nkisch like blood and iodine come through immediately. The wine then also presents notes of crushed stones, undergrowth and black pepper. Furthermore, a well integrated hint of barnyard funk, citrus and earth envelope the wine.

The palate shows intense fruit of sloe and dark cherry at first, minerality and earthy notes come through as well. A very fresh acidity and structured, but not overpowering tannins add structure. A long finish brings the wine to an end, showing notes of luxardo cherry, meat juices, leather and herbal tones.

Another Eisenberg-banger after the Weninger Saybritz for me! It shows a perfect interplay of fruity, savoury and lightly spicy notes at this point of development. It also has still a lot of life still in it, so extended aging would also be an option. If you enjoy BlaufrÃ¤nkisch of this style, definitely give it a try!"

Besides putting Perth about 900km too far north, the map of Western Australia seems to think an area of mostly arid desert around the size of Italy is all wine-country (if only!). 

I sent an email about this years ago but - despite numerous revisions to the list - the map remains unchanged, and so does my minor irritation.

Still, always good to have Margaret River and The Great Southern represented on such a brilliant list!"
Ideal Wine Cellar Inventory According to Little's Law,23,1gcbvpu,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gcbvpu/ideal_wine_cellar_inventory_according_to_littles/,13,2024-10-26 10:13:37,"Little's law is a quick way to determine the optimal number of widgets in a process, whether it is a part in a manufacturing process, or a bottle in a wine cellar. 

The law says that the number of inventory items during steady state is equal to the average processing time (holding period) multiplied by the consumption rate.

Steady Inventory = Holding Period X Consumption Rate

For example. If I consume 52 bottles of wine per year, and I want to cellar each bottle for an average of 5 years, my ideal cellar inventory is 52x5=260.

More than 260 bottles means I won't consume enough before they age out, less than 260 means I'm consuming more than what my target holding period will allow. 

It's a simple way to perform a gut check for the ""how much is too much?"" question regarding how much wine to buy and cellar. "
Shafer Chardonnay Red Shoulder Ranch ,13,1gcdk58,https://i.redd.it/ygomxzc081xd1.jpeg,13,2024-10-26 11:55:48,"Color: piss yellow if you hadnâ€™t drank water in 3 days 
 
Nose: citrus mushroom cream. gf said â€œ white wineâ€ 

Story: in the early 1990s we planted a beautiful rolling 68 acres site to Chardonnay here in Carneros in the cool southernmost part of Napa Valley it established our vineyard using sustainable farming practices. in 1994 we harvested our first fruit. this vintage celebrates 25 years of wine produced from the Chardonnay grown in our spectacular sight. 

Taste: round smooth almost perfect if it jumped out to me more. Cream, citrus, butter but not in a bad overoaked way. Itâ€™s balanced itâ€™s sturdy. Itâ€™s strong. Low acid, brioche lemon zest. Honestly such a balanced good wine itâ€™s hard to describe. 

Price: free but retails around $70 bucks think

Points: 94 I think. Itâ€™s honestly just so pure and smooth idk what to rate it. Itâ€™s such a good easy wine. If I could give this to someone to who says they hate California chard itâ€™d 100% change their mind. "

Pictured wines start with Petit Mouton, then Mouton â€˜09, then â€˜05, then Barsac â€˜08.

Here are my notes, with an albeit stuffy nose :(

Pastourelle de Clerc Milon 2020

meaty, austere, drinking well for its age. slight herbaciousness
88 points

Ch Clerc Milon 2018
More fruit than 2nd label, soft tannins, has 2% Carmenere which is very interesting .
94-95 points

NOTE: after tasting through everything in this wild lineup, the value/QPR of Clerc Milon really stood out to me!! I wish I took more detailed notes on this.

Ch d Armailhac 2015
soft nose, but not extremely expressive. fruit was there but a bit one dimensional. long lasting finish. 93 pts

Petit Mouton 2010
dark color, but the garnet is starting to appear on the edges
nose not as pronounced but came out a bit - likely just needed to open up
palate was fantastic. black cherry, dark fruit, slight graphite, vanilla,  tannis were present and a bit grippy. meaty and vanilla finish. this wine is about to enter its prime, if it isnâ€™t already. finish was long and enjoyable. 
95-96 pts


Mouton Rothschild 2009
color: still dark but the tawny look around the edges
nose: pronounced, black currant, dark and lightly stewed fruits
mouth: extremely silky, balanced, slightly warm, pronounced cherry, fresh vanilla, looong finish - creme brulee, vanilla, cherry. lasted 10 minutes if not longer

the finish specifically developed in my mouth - i wish we decanted!
97 pts - but i think if this was decanted it would reach 98

Mouton Rothschild 2005
dark and tawny color
nose: stewed fruit, some vanilla, toasted nuts
palate: fresh fruit on the edge of the palate that morphs into a somewhat stewed fruit on the center of the palate. still a good structure - this wine is in its early prime (for my palate) tannins are present and silky, but  leaves a grip that wants me wanting so much more.

97 pts - also probably needed a decant


Personally, â€˜09>â€™05, but they were both excellent.


Chateau Coutet Sauternes-Barsac 2008
nose: pear, citrus, ginger which allows the flavor to pierce through the nose
palate: the candied ginger is so awesome on this. it has all your classic sauternes notes, but the way the ginger makes this so unique has me really happy with this.

A Warning about RareStorage (K&Ls shipping affiliate) ,27,1gc6bha,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gc6bha/a_warning_about_rarestorage_kls_shipping_affiliate/,14,2024-10-26 05:17:52,"Update: I usually hate this kind of thing, but I donâ€™t want to put any business on blast if they donâ€™t deserve it. K&L left me a voicemail informing me they have refunded me in full. 

I was really happy to learn recently that K&L had a shipping affiliate that shipped to other states than CA. They're called RareStorage and the shipping rates seemed really reasonable. I filled up a couple cases of wine, paid for shipping and insurance and since then it has been a nightmare. 

They shipped my wine through GLS, who proceeded to drop my wine off in a different state than the one I live in. Now, nobody seems to know where it is, or when it will get to my house. K&L can't really help, although they have tried and their customer service is excellent, but RareStorage is a separate company. RareStorage won't talk to you on the phone and so you rely on email correspondence. They provided me with a new tracking number yesterday that was incorrect which further complicated things. I contacted GLS, who has assured me twice now that their operations team will contact me. That hasn't happened.

To K&Ls credit, they have really tried to help, but it seems their hands are tied. It also sounds like RareStorage uses different shipping companies for different states, so you could get lucky and have your wines shipped via UPS or Fed-Ex depending on your location. If you're considering having wines shipped through RareStorage, I would first inquire about which shipping company they'll use to get the wines to you. Also - for my state, there was not an overnight or 2 day shipping option. That probably should have raised red flags in itself, but by the time I realized that, it was too late. 

I know plenty of people here have had good experiences with K&L, and this really isn't their fault. But I did want to give the community a heads up that their affiliate is less commendable and your mileage may vary, depending on where you live. "

New to wine in general, brought back two bottles of champagne from a recent trip I was hoping to store for five years. Can I just vacuum seal the entire sealed champagne bottle and shove it in a normal fridge? I was reading that normal fridges get too dry which is bad for the cork and keeping the storage trouble free. I was thinking that by vacuum sealing the entire bottle it would keep humidity steady even in a normal fridge. The other solution I thought of was maybe wax dipping the top of the bottle which I would think would make it a more consistent humidity level.

I know nothing, y'all know a lot. Please help a brother out if you have a minute. I did try searching around in the sub but the closest I found to an answer was talking about slowing/stopping the aging of the wine using a vacuum bag, which is not what I'm looking to do.

100% Chardonnay

Medium yellow to light golden in color. 

On the nose: candied pineapple, mango, rice cakes, peach, saltine crackers, white flowers, balsa wood and dry stone. 

Medium to medium plus body, rich, unctuous, close to if not bone dry, medium acid but still pleasingly crisp, with notes of unsalted popcorn, yellow apple, Asian pear, fresh unripe pineapple, clementine skin, and chalk. Very slight tannic grip from oak aging, and overall the oak here is forward but well integrated. Intensely long finish with green apple and white nectarine, toasty oak. After about 2 hours of air, additional secondary notes of toasted almonds and cinnamon come through towards the finish. 

A gorgeous bottle of white wine and very solid example of the Chassagne-Montrachet style.

20% cabernet sauvignon
20% merlot

16 months barrique

Can age for another decade, needed air, tannins kick in, black currants, pencil, spice not a polished easy wine but can compete with left bank bordeaux.

I'm looking for tips, tricks and/or tactics for remembering wine details. 

I have just started as a somm and am finding that it is difficult to get all the details locked down for the wines. I am expected to remember the winemaking and tasting notes for all of the BTG and Pairing wines but I keep getting things mixed up or just can't seem to lock it into memory.

 For example, Elk Cove Pinot Noir comes from 6 sites that are fermented separately in stainless steel and blended then matured in French oak for 10 months, using Pommard and Dijon clones. Then I'll have Hartford Court Chardonnay from Russian River Valley in Sanoma that is barrel fermented with 28% new French oak and aged for 9.5 months with weekly lees string and goes through full malolactic conversion. 

  
Two very different wines, made in very different ways but when I have to remember those details for 20, 30, 40 plus wines I find that I get aging times mixed up or the blend mixed up and so on, especially if the wines are similar. 

  
Wondering if anyone out there has ideas for how to get these things memorized. Event if its seems simple, I am just trying to pool different ideas I could adopt.

However, I canâ€™t seem to find recommendations or â€˜literatureâ€™ on which producers to look for for good white Burg and what producers I should try to experience good Burg red. I am not really in the position to go splurging an grand cruâ€™s, but I am just curious what the experts of this subreddit would suggest.

Is stem inclusion in Pinot Noir the new overly-oaked Chardonnay?,38,1gbcdlg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gbcdlg/is_stem_inclusion_in_pinot_noir_the_new/,32,2024-10-25 03:22:16,"OK sorry for the clickbait title. 

But seriously, has anyone else feeling like there's been a huge increase in noticeably whole cluster fermented/stem included pinot noirs lately? I know it's not a new technique by any means, but in my memory it used to be something that added an extra je ne sais quoi to a vintage that maybe needed some help with complexity, not hit you over the palate stem-y chewy. If the first thing I notice when tasting a pinot is if it's had stem contact or not, IMO it's gone too far. Specifically on American pinots, which I get a fairly broad exposure to through work, feels like recently the volume has been turned up to 11. Maybe my palate is just super sensitive to it and no one else is noticing this trend. Do I need to start a ABSCP (anything but stem contact pinot) club to join the ABC club?"

Casanova di Neri & Tenuta Il Poggione were decanted for 2.5 hours before drinking and the Le ragnaie was poured out in the glass and we started drinking it after 45 mins .

to me the winner among these wines tonight is definitely the casanova di neri , come close at second place , le ragnaie 2019 which did not opened up as I hope during the night 

on the nose the 2018 casanova di neri is simply beautiful ,notes : plum , cherry , oaky , chocolate , tobacco , spice  , tannins are very well integrated .

ended the night with a bottle of Tokaji i brought back from my trip to Budapest , sold by Faust Wine Cellar . I have not tasted alot of tokaji or dessert wine , but this bottle is absolutely delightful to be paired with the pandan swissroll . perfect ending to the night

35th Birthday Party - what am I pulling from the Eurocave?,21,1gb66la,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gb66la,67,2024-10-24 23:02:40,
My Mt. Etna experience and the regionâ€™s parallels with Burgundy,181,1gateoa,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gateoa,35,2024-10-24 10:31:16,"I just got back from Sicily for my honeymoon, and as part of the trip that I got to plan we visited two wineries: Benanti and Girolamo Russo. Both had fantastic wines with great tour guides/somms that took you through a flight of 5 or 6 of their wines. What made the latter visit extra special however was getting to experience some of the harvest of their Nerello Mascalese grapes. 
As you might know, things go a little differently in Europe and you canâ€™t just stop by unannounced at the tasting room, you need to email them and reserve a time slot for a good 2-3 hr or longer experience likely to be paired with multiple courses and/or walks through the vineyard. 
Benantiâ€™s wines and historic production house turned modern showcase are impressive, with a large old wooden press and art adorning the rooms that had a sort of royal, medieval vibe to them, only surrounded by lava rocks. We tasted a beautiful sparkling metodo classico brut Rosato (that they no longer make or at least sell and distribute past 2020), a contrada bianco, a 10 yr old Nerello Cappuccio, and 2 more reds including a 2011 Serra Della Contessa, probably their most prized vineyard boasting centenarian vines behind the property on the side of a SE facing hill. This was all paired with thoughtfully paired food courses for each person. We didnt have the Pietra Marina, but I left with two 2019s after reading and hearing first hand how ageworthy it is.
Girolamo Russo is a newer winery with their own unique story that I wonâ€™t get into here, but the tour was incredibly special. The woman leading our experience let us work the sortable table before taking us through each of their main vineyards by having us follow in our rental car within the different contrade, or sub zones. We eventually walked up to their current tasting room if you can call it that, for their entire lineup including a metodo classico and pet-nat I didnâ€™t know they made. All these wines were just as impressive, each having their own character depending on the contrada they represented. 

After touring the vineyards I remember being struck by all parallels to Burgundy: the lava rock walls surrounding all the vineyards, much like a clos; thereâ€™s many different producers working in the same contrada, and Mt Etnaâ€™s wines are extremely elegant and mineral, with red and white expressions made from mostly single varietal grapes (especially the higher end bottles). I even remember thinking I could totally mistake Girolamo Russoâ€™s San Lorenzo Bianco for a high quality 1er cru Chablis. When I mentioned some of this to our somm she replied, â€œyou know they call it the Burgundy of the South!â€ She wasnâ€™t kiddingâ€”after looking back at the World Atlas of Wine, Jancis Robertson says â€œSome see it as the new CÃ´te dâ€™Or, and vine holdings are similarly parcellated.â€ 
Thereâ€™s a lot incredible wine there, with many relatively newer wineries tending some diverse and exciting terroir. And if you love bubbles, especially rose, thereâ€™s amazing QPR to be had there too! Vintage bottles of metodo classico brut rosato aged on its lees for 2-3 years can be found everywhere in shops for â‚¬25-30"

Snagged this at auction and have been excited to crack it! This wine is a blend of around 75% mourvÃ¨dre, 14% grenache and smaller amounts of cinsault, carignan and syrah (shiraz).

An enticing pale ruby colour. The nose is very aromatic with fruit cake, dried figs, cherry, and olive brine supported by an earthiness with some mushroom and lager.  

A light body with some light acidity right out the bottle complimented by very fine chalky tannins which dissipate over the second pour. Immediately getting sour cherries with strawberries and red currants. The secondary earthiness is also present with that great mushroom and cured meat which gives it that classic French savoury feel. Dark red fruits emerge with some air and are persistent through the finish. 

This is delicious, I fuck with Bandol, especially this cuvÃ©e."

* Aged whites are worth looking into for more interesting
* If it's some weird (not popular) grape variety, it's worth a shot
* I usually limit my regions and countries so I don't have too many variables so I can know what to expect a little more flavor wise - as regions within countries can be so different (like South Africa)

Despite my being able to find no flaw - everything was in balance, the tannins were pleasant, acid was appropriate, and they made no mistakes such as being too fruit-forward or having a weird finish - this wine made me bored. 

What can I tell you about its character? Nothing, I could not detect any. The nose? Your basic Bordeaux nose, albeit in more restrained intensity than I expected.

Decanted for about half an hour and then drunk over the next hour, it might have opened up given more time but it didn't ""feel"" like a tight wine waiting to uncoil. 

I'd happily drink it anytime it was offered, but I think I will forget this wine sooner than I'll seek it out."

Poggio di Sotto Brunello di Montalcino 2017

Decanted and drank over two hours. 

My first experience with this legendary Brunello producer and it did not disappoint.

2017 has an unfair rep as a ""bad"" vintage, but I think 2017 Brunello from good producer is still good Brunello and, very importantly, pretty ready to drink now. This isn't for aging over decades (save that for the 2016s and 2019s).

Initially pretty tannic, but with air, really opened up.

Notes of red cherry, red plum, chestnut, soil. Over time, the fruit notes came to the forefront.

Really lovely wine that could benefit from further aging, but is already approachable.

93 points.

Daniel Rion & Fils Vosne-Romanee Les Chaumes 1er Cru 2017

Ready to drink now. Needs a little air, but not heavy decanting (although I did decant it).

Very fruit-forward Bourgogne, ripe fruit, bright cherry notes. 

Nose is almost perfumey with floral notes of rose and cherry blossom. Almost reminds me of my wife's perfume. 

Drinking lovely now.

92 points.

Very fun experience and would drink both again any day of the week! "

Thereâ€™s a beautiful floral character as well, with hints of potpourri and violets. Subtle spices of vanilla and pepper, alongside a touch of cinnamon, create a layered complexity, while refreshing notes of mint and licorice add intrigue. I love the playful hints of orange peel and candied zest that linger in the background.

On the palate, itâ€™s a true delight. The wine is full-bodied yet effortlessly elegant, with well-integrated tannins and vibrant acidity that make each sip a pleasure.

Are Vinotemp wine fridges still considered a good budget pick?,6,1gamejh,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gamejh/are_vinotemp_wine_fridges_still_considered_a_good/,7,2024-10-24 04:49:28,"I saw this 157-bottle Vinotemp for sale at Lowe's for just $630 - nothing seems to be even close to that price for a similar capacity. I'd heard some reports of failure after a couple years in general for this brand, but I'd think any brand besides Eurocaves carries that risk - if it lasts even 6-8 years I'd consider it a win for this price. The side-loading bottle layout could also be problematic for some bottle sizes, but even staggering bottles the capacity should be sufficient for the price.

Explosion of red berries on the nose. Like a smoothy of raspberries that is deliciously inviting. Background notes of sagebrush and dessert shrubs but really the raspberries stole all my attention.

On the palate, you immediately think bright red fruits that give a full mouth feel but without making you exhausted with it being a typical CA red wine. It was bright and lovely and balance with a nice acidity. The finsih went on for days, like a treat.

Overall it's a classy example of Anderson Valley pinot noir. Really love to drink on its own but I snacked on some charcuterie and truffle cheese, which was perfect.

I'm from Germany, specifically from the Riesling region, where wine is a big part of the culture. Funny enough, I noticed pretty early on that I can't really handle wine. Where Iâ€™m from, itâ€™s common to mix white wine with water to make a refreshing spritzer, so I didn't think much about it growing up since it was always diluted.

As I got older, I moved away from white wine and started trying red wines, but soon switched almost entirely to beer after spending some time in Bavaria. Now Iâ€™ve realized that whenever I have just one glass of wine, it gives me stomachaches and gastrointestinal issues that last through the next day. At first, I thought maybe it was an alcohol thing, but I can drink two liters of beer without any problems.

Has anyone else experienced this? Could there be something specific in wine that causes these issues? Or is it possible that beer, with its anti-inflammatory compounds, helps counteract the effects of alcohol on my stomach?

Any insights would be appreciated!

Gorgeous lift and ethereal aromatics (med+), red, sappy and high toned fruits coalesce with spice and minerality from the terroir for a great stem to glass representation.  The palate is medium bodied with med+ flavor density.  Med+ fresh finish.  Really great into to what the Pataille wines are like. Decant for 2 hours."

What was unique was it undergoes spontaneous fermentation in steel tanks then undergoes fermentation in the bottle ""using the ancestral method without disgorgement (sur lies). No filtration, stabilization, or clarification."", according to their website.

What is the best way to drink this? I just opened it up. Should I decant it, cork it back or what?  "

Stefano Amerighi syrah 2021,16,1g7gxud,https://i.redd.it/csplpjwtnrvd1.jpeg,24,2024-10-20 02:42:42,"I hear a lot of people saying this is the best syrah outside France, so i thought i could get some shit making a post about it.

Premises: 
-I'm not a syrah connoisseur so i'm not compairing this with other wines but i'll refer to basic stuff i know about this variety, so feel free to correct me.

-I decanted it because it felt extremely closed after i tasted it and i didn't have time to see how long would have taked to open leaving it by itself. (Explanation for the non americans that don't decant every liquid contained in a glass bottle /s)

Since i pass by cortona very often for work, i went to this lovely winery to grab a couple of bottles.
They finished E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G. They've got nothing till next April. They kindly redirected me to a nice local grocery shop that had some. Lucky me

The winery is byodinamic and they say in the back label they press the grapes with feets. (Yummy)

Sooo, great color, deep dark ruby with violet shades, nonetheless, it leaves light pass through its body even enancing the brightness, when put under a lamp.
Less viscous than i would expect.

While smelling the cork i've got a strong hint of licorice that wasn't so dominant after.
In the glass the wine wasn't particularly intense, i could't properly discern many of the aromas exeption made for obvious violets, maybe some red roses, blackberries, ripe plums, sour cherries under spirit and the weakened hint of licorice.

In the mouth it felt very unbalanced, a strong acidity covered most of the wine's body. Alcol, low viscosity and sweetness weren't balancing the hardness of the wine.

I decanted it for about an hour, during this hour i sampled it and i might have smelled something a bit off one time. No trace of that after pouring at the end of decantation.

Now the nose was good: hint of tobacco added to the width of the wine, some fruit switched a bit on the jammy side and the sour cherry lost the alcoholic tone that was a bit too penetrative on the first try.

Mouth got the best out of it. Obviousely the acidity lowered and left space to some of the best tannins i've ever felt: smooth, silky and well integrated, i almost wanted to have more of em.
At this point the alcol was doing his job, supporting the sharp oriented body of the wine, so the low viscosity could leave you drink this well bodied wine like an easy pinot noir. Majestic job from the winemaker.
Finish was long enough, not something out of the world

The empty glass left a lovely, proustian for me, blackberry jam scent.

Few sediments were left on the bottom of the decanter.

I paired it with polish veil steak, dry-aged for 35 days and my 2 days old olive oil.
I was scared the dry-aging might have made the meat a bit too hematic and intense for the wine but it worked like a charm. The body of the wine integrated with the strong meat flavor and the acidity cleaned the greasiness of the fat and the oil, leaving the soft tannins and the animal flavor for long on the tongue.

30â‚¬   great, great wine. 95-96 points (93-94 imho) only took away points for complexity, equilibrium and intensity.
I didn't consider the sediments since they weren't it the tasted glass and gave max points for visual look. Maximum points for quality on both nose and mouth even if i'm not conviced about that. I think suckling gave it 98pt (wtf)


Ok, but why i didn't like it enough?

-In the end the acidity lowered but was still a bit too much, you could taste the greatness of the wine but idk, you had to kinda look at it through a window(?).
It needs few more years on his back, i hope the rest of the body won't lose anything

-I read about people saying this wine has great complexity. That's not what i call ""great complexity"".
1 flower and a half, 3 dark fruits and licorice is not complex, is the average note of a rich newbie tasting Petrus.
What are you gonna call a wine with 10 well defined deacriptors and hints of tar, vinyl and leather?
Even konstantin baum sais it has some flowers, blackberries, plum and pepper (that i don't actually percieve here and he explains why that's pretty common) and then proceeds to sing the praises of the great complexity of this wine. Am i missing something or that's just as wrong as it seems to me?

-I admit it just isn't my genre of wine lol.

What a stunning wine. This taste way more expensive than a Bourgogne should/could taste. Opened last night and continue to drink today.

Smell of red berries not as light as strawberry more like cherry and leather very approachable from such a young age.

Taste of spice and a cherry and acidic of a very fresh minerality, reminded me of why I love pinot. After 3 recent bottles of Bourgogne rouge I have drank in the past 2 months(not posted here because it didnt really impressed me as much). This is great.

From my experience, I have had way too many Bourgogne rouge that is just too breathless from being way too young. I think Bourgogne rouge should be approachable from release. Why would I have to wait for it if I also have to wait on village, premier cru and GC."
Gewurtz Going The Distance: 2009 Barmes-Buecher Gewurtztraminer Rosenberg ,24,1g7btvg,https://i.redd.it/dovnwj79iqvd1.jpeg,7,2024-10-19 22:49:31,"This is my first post about a specific wine on here so take it easy on me as I try to work on my tasting notes. 

I've been a growing fan of aromatic white wines with Alsace being chief among my go-to regions. I recently returned from my second stay in the area last month and decided to seek out some interesting wines back here state-side. 

I've not had the opportunity to visit Domaines Barmes-Buecher in my travels to Alsace, but it is definitely on my short list for a potential third trip. This particular bottling comes from the hills to the south-west of Wettolsheim, which is just west of Colmar. I absolutely love the older style label, it reflects much of the character of the region, even of it is a little marketing unfriendly. 

Onto what ended up in the glass: PnP initially and let it develop in the open bottle over the course of the evening. Deep gold/amber color, floral, honey and dried peach aromas. Flavors of honeysuckle, candied walnuts, dried peach, apricot and lychee. Medium long finish with some herbal spice and lasting sweetness. 

I had some initial concern about the age of this bottle vis-a-vis it's lieu-dit status. While a Grand Cru Gewurz could easily go for this kind of age, (or Trimbach's Seigneurs de Ribeaupierre) I wasn't sure about this producer's style, the individual terroir, or how much RS was there to help this expression along. This ended up being a treat, and I'm further convinced of the underrated ability of Gewurztraminer to age, at least when it is of the opulent Alsace style. "

I'm a huge fan of half bottles, they let you enjoy a glass of nice wine without committing to an entire bottle. Perfect for a glass at home before going out for the night.

Stood up for a few hours before opening. Needed a Durand to open, there was some discoloration on top of the cork. Thankfully, cork didn't crumble and bottle was totally fine, no cork taint, no brett.

First sip was actually ready to drink right away, tannins weren't harsh at all. But decided to slow ox for an hour before drinking, then drank over the next hour.

Over time, developed notes of dark plum, blackberry, dark cherry, rosemary. On the palate, medium acidity and nice long finish. Tannins definitely mellowed out with age. 

Shockingly, this paired very well with spicy pongal (a South Indian rice and lentil based dish). Another reminder that Indian food can pair really well with the right red wine, even though restaurants continue to insist on sparkling and semi-dry whites as the right pairing. 

I'd say this is squarely in the drinking window. I think there are years ahead on this, but I don't expect it to get better with time. 

I have one more half bottle left and intend to enjoy it in the same manner within the next two years.

Help needed! Recognisable wines to be featured in movie?,0,1g7bjam,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1g7bjam/help_needed_recognisable_wines_to_be_featured_in/,20,2024-10-19 22:36:01,"Who are some â€œrecognisableâ€ producers?

Perhaps a slightly wacky question, but I need you, Reddit hive mind!

This is for a movie project Iâ€™m working on. The movie deals with generational divides and similarities at large, which is illustrated through various avenues, one of which being food and wine.

There are two subplot characters who get in a whole thing walking through different wine stores/looking at wine lists (probably the former but possibly the latter), with the younger character being super into natural wine and the older character being into (everyday) classics. For the natural wines I have a list already, including bottles like some Pheasantâ€™s Tears from Georgia, Bonhommeâ€™s Telquel, Meinklang Weisser Mulatschak, Gabrio Bini, Tissot, Matassa, EnvÃ­nate,â€¦

My question is: what are the equivalent producers in conventional winemaking? So not Barefoot, La Vieille Ferme, 19 Crimes, or Yellowtail, but what are some labels that the audience would recognise both visually and as good, solid (maybe even outstanding) bottles?

The AligotÃ© La Charme Aux PrÃªtres 2019 is ready and floral, with its aromas of citrus, grapefruit, white pepper, and a very light note of vanilla. The oak is expertly managed by Sylvain Pataille, who proves to be a great winemaker. On the palate, there's a distinct minerality that pairs well with a nice salinity. The finish is very long.
A great white wine, after all, it comes from one of the best crus of the appellation.

The Maranges 1er Cru La FussiÃ¨re 2020 is exceptional. In my opinion, the Domaine is among the best in the appellation. It can already be drunk now. On the nose, it's elegant with notes of wild strawberries and cherries, followed by a sensation of pomegranate, then flowers along with a clear balsamic note and mint. On the palate, it's smooth with its small silky tannins. The precise fruit melds with iodine notes and an elegant minerality. Long finish.

Colchagua Valley Cruisin',122,1g64iob,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g64iob,25,2024-10-18 06:30:21,"I've spent the last two days driving around Colchagua Valley in Chile and wanted to share some of my experience. I did some hurried research before this trip, but based on what I saw on this sub, there's room for more info to be put out there for the benefit of anyone thinking about a tour.

First, some logistics: Colchagua Valley is about a 2:30hr drive from Santiago Airport. Renting a car and making the drive is pretty easy - drive on the right like in the States, tolls are almost all taken care of electronically (like EZPass/SunPass) and are included in the rental price. Have some cash in case you find a booth that requires it. Be careful of surprise school zones with accompanying speed humps in the middle of a 70kph road.

There are a few towns that serve as anchor points in the valley. I stayed at a lovely hotel outside of Santa Cruz, Hotel Noi Blend. Super quiet in the middle of the vineyard fields, but not part of a winery. 

If you look at a map, you'll see a crescent-shaped mountain range just northeast of Santa Cruz. I basically did a lap around that. The landscape is beautiful with the Andes in the distance, and it's generally a fun drive.

I hit two wineries because I arrived in the afternoon Day 1, and Day 2 was kind of a trek. I booked in advance with Clos de Apalta (sister label of Lapostolle, actually their premium label), and ViÃ±a Vik. Both times, it was just myself and my wife on the English speaking tour. This seems to be an area more frequented by Latin American tourists. I would HIGHLY recommend knowing some Spanish, because almost no one speaks English outside of Santiago. I'm not saying that as a demonstration of anglophone privilege, it's just a fact this far away from the English-speaking world.

Winery impressions: Clos de Apalta was beautiful. They clearly care a lot about their process. Instead of steel tanks for fermentation, they use MASSIVE 7,500 liter oak barrels that they change every few years. Annual production is 20k cases. Lapostolle uses steel and cranks out 120k. The 7-story gravity system is some pretty remarkable engineering and really worth seeing. They also claim to have the oldest Carmanere vines in the region dating back to 1907.

ViÃ±a Vik has a bit more of a haughty air. Steel tanks everywhere but under a very impressive building. They import precut French oak to build their own barrels, which they then smoke with Chilean oak for a more subtle flavor. It was a cool process to see, but not quite the ""ooh-aah"" that I got with Clos. Their restaurant was very fine dining with a prix fix menu at $75pp, which includes two glasses of wine.

Wine impressions: I found out that I really like Carmenere! It's a brighter grape on the tongue but has lots of depth to it. I'm not an oenephile but I do have something of a palette, so I'll try my best here. Clos Apalta had three wines that we tried. Le Petit Clos 2020 was fun, everyday drinkable. It's the ""little brother"" of their major eponymous wine. Clos Apalta 2020 and 2012 were next. Even the guide agreed that the 2020 needed more time to mature. The 2012 was definitely a FULL expression of Carmenere, almost too much. Overall, we thought they were all delicious but would've aged the 2020 more.

ViÃ±a Vik had us try straight-from-the-barrel pours of Cab Sav and Carmenere to get a handle on the grape. Then we tried Milla Cala (our favorite), Vik the namesake, and La Piu Belle. Milla Cala was again, fun and drinkable. Not something you have to sit there and ponder over, but something to be enjoyed in the moment. I hope that makes sense. Vik was heavy and required time to chew on. Crazy long finish. Piu Belle was nice, but we tried their rosÃ© during dinner and that was SO much better. Overall, I think ViÃ±a Vik won the tasting contest.

Anyways, I hope this helps anyone looking to head out that way. It certainly opened my eyes to the better possibilities of Chilean wines. And there were TONS more wineries to explore, so I'll have to come back. Cheers!"

Can minerality come from unwashed grapes?,10,1g6h6i2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1g6h6i2/can_minerality_come_from_unwashed_grapes/,59,2024-10-18 19:45:12,"Hey guys!

I'm new to studying wine (I've done WSET Level 2 and CMS intro and I'm currently studying for both WSET 3 and CMS certified). I keep getting hung up on the concept of minerality. I know minerality in wine is a highly contested topic, the main argument being that grapes will not absorb the flavors of the soil they are grown in simply by being grown in them. Of course, this argument makes sense, but I'm having difficulty accepting that there is absolutely no correlation, given how certain wines do have minerality which can be percepted (even being able to differentiate between salinity, wet rock, limestone, flint, etc). 

After realizing most grapes aren't washed before fermentation, the logical conclusion that keeps coming into my brain is that the flavors are imparted from the organic matter left on the skins of the grapes.  I mean, if I dunk anything in salt water and then eat it, it should have a hint of saltiness, right? If I seasoned a piece of meat and left it to marinate for a few days, even if I rinsed it off before I cooked it, there should definitely be a lingering presence of the seasonings, no? I feel like this is definitely an over simplification that should have been mentioned and disproved by now, but I'm having trouble finding anything that talks about the difference washing grapes can make on flavor- everything I find focuses on native yeast and the effects on spontaneous fermentation. Please let me know if there are any materials (lectures, books, etc) that mention this/if I'm going crazy

Thanks!"

Champagne type choice?,5,1g6iqgw,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1g6iqgw/champagne_type_choice/,14,2024-10-18 20:59:53,"When we were married we were given bottles of champagne, nothing fancy but those 'higher end supermarket' wines. There was a Moet, a Taittinger and one other I cannot remember. 

We opened one with the birth of each child and it became a mini tradition. Now we are having our fourth (and hopefully final haha) child and I wanted another bottle to continue the tradition. I was very tempted to go crazy and buy something like a Krug GC 171 but it's very hard to justify when I probably wouldn't appreciate it.

So I want a decent Â£50-100 bottle of 'celebration' wine and came across Eric Rodez wines while searching for options and they sound nice. 

The problem is that there are loads of choices (sweetness levels, BbB, BbN etc) and I have no real experience of selecting champagne. I generally prefer complex red wine but my wife prefers sweeter white if that helps (yes we are opposites). What bottle should I pick?"

The entire Dutch side is coming over and everybody expects me to handle the wine. I thought it would be nice to try some American wines over there as they are a bit overpriced and also rare on this side of the pond. That's why I was hoping people could give me some recommendations, preferably available for shipping to Florida. I am not a fan of topheavy overripe raisinny or oxidative wines, US wines I have tried and loved are Sandhi and Evening land(Raj Parr fan I guess). So slightly reductive, fresher and more nuanced/elegant styles I guess. Your recommendations would really mean a lot to me as US wine really is a bit of a blind spot and people on this subreddit seem so incredibly knowledgeable about them! I put the categories I'm looking for and some ideas I have had below. 60$ is not a hard limit but if I can keep the average around 50 a bottle I would be very happy.

(Edit: I find US wines to be a bit overpriced in the Netherlands specifically, there are many markets where they are great value and even some offer exceptional value in my country, just to be clear I am not a hater.)

Categories I'm looking for(and wines I am thinking of):

Sparkling: No clue :( I like a lot of lees and blanc de noir is generally a plus

Light white: No clue :( Big fan of Saumur Chenin, Silex Sancerre, Timorasso, Aligote or basically everything. Have not often liked new world Sauvignon Blanc though, tends to be a bit fruit heavy. Family doesnt like Riesling which is sad. Really not too aware of American whites outside of Chard and SauvB so anything cool/niche that comes to mind would be great!

Big white: Sandhi Santa Rita Hills Chardonnay(have not tried other bottlings), Bodega Chacra Mainque(found a good price am open to US equivalents)

Light Red: Evening Land Eloa Amity Hills Seven Springs Pinot Noir

Big Red: No clue :( I specifically do not want Cabernet or Merlot, was thinking some Syrah or GSM blends would be cool any other recommendations also more than welcome! Something structured with vibrant fruit and good balance would be appreciated :) Edit: Am really interested in varietal Syrah bottlings actually, any good producers? Looking at Mark Ryan wild eyes and L'ecole no 41 estate syrah right now, but I do not know the producers.

Dessert wine always a bonus :P (Edit: Riesling would be fine in a dessert wine, apologies for being unclear)

Thank you so much in advance and good luck with your thanksgiving plans <3

Wine Cooler/Fridge Advice Needed for Unconventional Reason!,1,1g62w3h,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1g62w3h/wine_coolerfridge_advice_needed_for/,2,2024-10-18 05:11:46,"Greetings fellow oenophiles!

Sadly, when I moved out of my last home nearly 2 years ago, we were unable to lug our ancient beast of a 300-400 bottle wine storage vault up the stairs of our 115 yr-old home and therefore had to include it as a ""feature"" of the sale (it worked btw!). We also had to drain my collection of fine wines prior to and after the sale since we didn't have a great place to store them in our ""new"" 110 yr-old home that we are now doing a full gut reno on. It was truly a VERY painful endeavor.  :)  My liver is still recovering, ha!

Anyway, here's an unusual question for you: I need a temperature and humidity-controlled space in which to store my dahlia tubers over the winter after I dig them out of the ground. A **single-zone** wine fridge/cooler with roughly a minimum of 36-48 bottle capacity (but bigger is always better), preferably less than $1000 US, and A STABLE TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY unit is what I need (temps in the 40s-50 F). I don't care if it's damn ugly, free-standing, etc., as it will be in my basement and have a temperature and humidity monitor in it. I cannot over-emphasize how important the stability of the temperature and humidity are. I have thousands of dollars invested in these tubers (not to mention all of the love and sweat equity that goes with gardening), so I cannot afford to lose them. 

As a trial, I bought one on Amazon during Prime Days last week for about $300 (by Antarctic) and have been monitoring the temps/humidity daily based on different temp settings ranging from 42-50 F. It has frankly been very disturbing. The photo shows the 3 monitors I had placed in it when I set the wine fridge at 43 F. (Note: I put the 2nd digital monitor and regular thermometer in 2 days later in order to ensure that the original digital monitor was accurate.) Bottom line: this unit is a piece of sh\*t due to the wild variations, and I didn't even mention the condensation on the inside. I will try to initiate a return to Amazon. Sigh...

Based on this, can you please provide me with your recommendations? I've been looking at TONS of reviews on-line in every place imaginable, but there doesn't appear to be a consensus. Again, I need a single-zone unit. Do you have any knowledge about the Cosmo 24"" 48-bottle unit (approx. $880 US)? It seems to get good reviews, but I'm doubtful of everything at this point. I'll take any and all recommendations, as I have to begin my harvest soon!

PS I don't want to buy a used unit on FB Marketplace, Craigslist, etc., as I don't want to take any further chances with reliability, etc.

Many thanks!"

So we are trying to decipher when a bottle of champagne we have might have been produced. So hoping there might be some people here who can help.

Backstory - itâ€™s part of a collection we manage and the story is the guy who the collection is about (Bruce McLaren) won/podium at a race in Reims. As a reward he got a case of champagne.

Naturally over the years these things disappear. Most likely was enjoyed at a house party or two! However one was donated to the collection saying it was a bottle Bruce won at Reims.

However photos of him on the podium show a different style label on the neck.

Champagne 
Heidsieck & Co
Dry Monopole

Interesting notes to help decipher
- has a royal warrant from the Queen
- contents is in pint/ounces

I have a photo of Bruce celebrating with a bottle same brand different neck label. Circa 1962.

Hopefully some wine detectives here :)"

Brett never fully faded, but the wine did open up nicely and showed from cherry and plum notes, more on the stewed side.

This is definitely past its prime, but still very enjoyable and a wonderful experience!

Pinot Noir from Oregon made by French producers. Is this heaven?,250,1g4fx8k,https://i.redd.it/85512yq30zud1.jpeg,73,2024-10-16 02:19:39,"The quality of this Pinot noir made by Drouhin in Oregon is out of this world! The French freshness is well present while the fruit forward American cherry balances it. Ruby colour with a beautiful nose of raspberry and oak, the palate is intense in red cherry and forest floor while the minerals stand out. The complex finish reveals amazing vanilla pods and leather while the fruit turns into a beautiful cranberry jam in your mouth. This is special and an amazing pair with a homemade chestnut and sage risotto, yum!"

The material also has to be sturdy in case the bottles need to be moved around in the storage room. We will need to label close to 22â€™000 bottles of wine.

What's the funniest or supidest experience you've have while drinking wine or opening a bottle?,26,1g4hddg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1g4hddg/whats_the_funniest_or_supidest_experience_youve/,12,2024-10-16 03:21:06,"List them! My personal faves:

1. My friend and her mom were visiting me, was their last night in Paris so we decided to open a bottle of wine and enjoy the view of the Eiffel tower. But we forgot a corkscrew, all the shops were closed, and for some reason nobody we asked had one. So we decided to come up with a plan, I would hold the bottle and jam a stick into the cork, and my friend would step on it. I did it before. Well, this time the bottle instantly exploded and lacerated my hand pretty badly, so the romantic sunset was cut short because we had to go wash my bloody and and arm off. Also because it was an air b' n b, there was nothing in the apartment so I just wrapped it in toilet paper.

2. Using 'the Breton method' to open a bottle of wine...once again, no bottle opener. So you take a shoe, put the bottle in it, and tap or bang it against a concrete wall. Worked like a charm and the night was saved! 

3. I was drinking some champagne with two or three friends in CafÃ© Oz. The bartenders started spraying champagne into the bar for a bit of entertainment, which is fun, but they accidentally sprayed my friend right in the face and her hair was soaked haha. She was not happy about that, but it was still funny. Then a few minutes later some crazy Australians threw like two beer bottles and they exploded on the wall right above us.

4. A friend's younger brother wanted to open a wine bottle, I said no, let me do it. He insisted. The cork flew up right in his face (literally flinging his hair on his forehead up) then bounced around everywhere. He dad also opened a bottle of wine/champagne with a sabre-like knife a few times, which was pretty cool."

- Century tour & library tasting: covers current releases & older vintage counterparts  
- â€œMonte Belloâ€ cab tasting: which seems to focus on wines specifically from the Monte Bello vineyard including current release M.B.

I'm at the very beginning of my wine journey and want to focus on learning the ""basic/classic"" grapes, which I'd think would be pinot gris, sauvignon blanc, chardonnay, pinot noir, and cab sauv.

* **(1) Would you add anything else to ""basics/classics?"" these?** Gamay? Cab Franc? Merlot?

I want to get a strong sense of what is typical for these grapes. Thus,

* **(2) How many wines should I (reasonably) drink of each grape?**

>-> Obviously if I had unlimited time and budget, I would drink as many as possible, but I also don't think these grapes will be my favorites (right now I like things like Moscato d'Asti, Albarino, and orange wines, to be honest). So I am thinking 3-5? But I'm also mostly working on this alone, so I will probably waste lots of these bottles, especially if I'm trying to do them simultaneously? **(Is there any way to buy tiny wines, like the half bottles, or maybe you'd recommend I just go to a wine bar and drink glasses, so I'd pay the same prices but not waste?)**

* **(3) Of the number of wines I'm targetting for each grape, would you recommend focusing on just one region?**

>-> For instance, I could just drink French for all of these grapes; or for something like Pino Gris, which seems majority Italian, I could exclusively drink Italian? I think I'm trying to get a ""pure"" comparison

* **(4) Or is the idea more to drink one typical cheap one of the grape, one typical expensive wine of the grape, and a few weird category-stretching ones** (e.g., make sure to taste a ""typical"" stainless steel chardonnay in addition typical oak-aged ones)?
* **(5) How can I predict in advance whether a given wine will teach me about typicality? I would love specific recommendations for three typical chardonnays, for instance. Or is this the kind of thing to just ask at a wine shop, rather than on Reddit?**

**Or am I thinking about all of this all wrong?**

That said, I know itâ€™s a common opinion that in a tasting you should keep the wines fairly similar and stick to one consistent theme. Personally, I like tasting a bunch of different things and I think it helps you figure out what you really like, but I can also understand the argument that you will only really understand a wine in the context of other similar wines. Thereâ€™s also the fact that the order of the wines matters, I donâ€™t want the Riesling to make the Chardonnay seem flabby or the Rioja to be too intense after the Chardonnay. Weâ€™ll be having food between though, so Iâ€™m not too worried, but stillâ€¦ Thoughts?"

For the past two years, occasionally, maybe 10 times a year, weâ€™ll have a white wine at home, freshly bought from the fridge from a different bottle shop each time, and different brands and price ranges from cheap to expensive too.  Iâ€™ve found no correlation in the wine type, brand, cost or store where itâ€™s from. 

Weâ€™ve even stored wine in different fridges, but itâ€™s always a random wine. Weâ€™ll drink the first half of the bottle but the second half will generally taste like acid, make us gag, and generally there will be crystals in the bottom of the glass.

If you try to drink it, youâ€™ll vomit. If you add a mixer, it cannot mask the taste and youâ€™ll gag. 

Iâ€™ve asked a few people and Iâ€™ve been told tartrate crystals donâ€™t impact taste. The wine does not smell, and it is not kept outside of the fridge or open very long (max 3 days, sometimes shared in the same night and cannot be finished due to the issue). 

Whatâ€™s happening? Is there anything we can do to avoid it or is this supply chain issues?

The bulk of US wine acreage comes from the hot dry CA Central Valley - almost entirely planted with the wrong varieties,146,1g3mivd,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1g3mivd/the_bulk_of_us_wine_acreage_comes_from_the_hot/,73,2024-10-15 01:11:14,"The Central Valley grows 70% of California wine grapes, and California grows 80% of US grapes. This region alone counting for over half of US wine production (56%)! The area has a reputation for low quality wine, which doesn't seem too surprising given the mismatch between what's planted and what the climate is. The three varieties that come out as quality are Zinfandel, Petite Syrah, and Barbera - ALL warm southern varieties.

Looking at what's grown, it appears that some group of 'experts' made a bunch of horrible decisions decades ago to fill the region with a bunch of cool climate northern French varieties, because that was what consumers recognized. It's the same stuff as grown on the coast, except the coast is obviously going to do cool better.

Looking at Wine Folly's grape list [https://winefolly.com/grapes/](https://winefolly.com/grapes/), there's TONs of Spanish, Italian, Hungarian, Greek white and red varieties. Why the heck aren't these planted in the Central Valley? Where's the Xinomavro, Savatiano, Nero dâ€™Avola, Moschofilero? That's the type of stuff that should grow well.

People gripe about CA wine being either cheap crap or too expensive. I don't think the Coast is going to get cheaper, but I think there should be huge potential for the cheap crap to get good. The old world figured out what grew where and optimized. Seems like the US is still very much in trial and error phase. "

It was really incredible, way better than I expected. I opened at 12pm and tasted every hour or so until dinner at 6.30pm. It started with a very pretty nose of flowers and cherries but the palate was quite thin. Over time the nose evolved into a richer dusty red cherry and subtle cigar spice and the palate got richer and denser with more tannins and acidity and a very long and layered finish. By dinner it was just perfect. Dusty red cherries with a lovely hint of cedar and spice with mouthwatering acidity and really nice tannins. The finish was well over a minute and came in waves of different flavors. I drank it with carbonara, which is my favorite pairing for Sangiovese. If it is this good now I canâ€™t even imagine in 10-15 years."

An hour later it had developed a hint of an almost soy sauce type scent and the fruit started to show itself - it was strange, like it started to become more flavorful as it sat. 

At 2 hours, caramel and ripe fruits started to come through and the scent of soy subsided. It was excellent! I didnâ€™t write tasting notes down so I canâ€™t be more specific than those few that I remember but WOW what an experience! "

I am a wine sales rep in a metropolitan city. A very small company and this is my first job in the industry. Currently my pay structure is 99% commission (i basically dont get paid a base salary). I want to ask all of you in the wine industry; is this normal?

Again i work for a small company, unknown fine wines (theyre great wines tho), and i feel like i was taken advantage of while onboarding for this company. Its my first ""adult"" job if you will. Most of my pay *will* come from commission and i say that because i havent recieved any of my sales commission yet since it takes a while for that commission to come in. 

Since starting, I have opened new accounts, I dont get a current account list or any helpful resources for accounts. 

My commission isnt extravagantly high. I have a smaller portfolio and only really sell wine. I havent gotten to form a relationship yet to get good placements with on-premise accounts to do any by the glass programs, which is expected. 

I know for many other distribution/ supplier companies, sales reps or something of this nature with commission usually has a base pay. It may not be the most generous but they still include a **liveable** base pay. I dont have that. Im currently working a hospitality job weekends and nights to at least put food on the table and pay bills. Is that normal?

Would like any and all opinions. "

Not as easily available in Asia. At a grocery store in Georgetown found a decent selection. A better priced bottle and from France, perfect! It must taste good. Grab 2 Merlots from the same company it appeared. (Did a lot of shopping so only a brief look.)

Later when opened, we were disappointed it tasted mostly like fruit juice. My wife said like a cheap bottled sangria from the store. Sip more, look at bottles more....1 of them (pictured,) has a spelling error on the back. Alarmed, we start looking the bottles over, googling about fake alcohol which we have heard about. Of course find horror stories online but, doesn't seem like what we have.

Then, she screams out "" omg there's another label under it.."" Basically, there's a near transparent label below the label on the back that really only shows up with a light shining on it. Although the white labels clearly say they're from France, and mention the specific region....the wine is from Malaysia, and it's fruit juice and additives.

We really don't know what to say. Shocked, upset, glad we weren't poisoned by what it could have been we suppose. So now don't even know where to share this but want to because this is 1. Interesting and terrible 2.somehow want to let others know this can happen.

I'm feeling I need a bit of a change in my boozing, and have gotten my every-few-years itch for wine. I started looking into wines again and just figured I'd get a comment or two here if possible to address - 

* I am an IPA fan from early in my career. I know I don't have an interest in particularly sweet wines, but are there any types/genres/brands of wines you'd recommend from this as a starting point?
* How well does wine keep after opening? I can go through a six pack in a weekend or a week, and I don't know how well opened wine keeps. Is it best to finish a bottle within a night or two, or is it fine for 5+ days?
* My biggest pain point for getting into wine is that I find the taste to be predominantly ""alcohol"" in the same way I find a beer over 10-11%. Something like tequila I can often enjoy for just the taste despite it obviously being higher %. Is this just a case of acquiring a taste for wine? Or is it something like ""oh you've only had X wine, or only had cheap wine""? Because if anything I'd rather get a bottle of wine for cheaper than a 6 pack, or at least to have it last longer glass-to-can. 

Thank you whether or not I am given answers or am just told to shove off. "

I grabbed this bottle of their Pinot noir, curious they're even growing it there at all, quite uncommon around there. Also I just love Pinot, what can I say? Didn't have terribly high expectations.

I was more than impressed. My immediate impression was ""old world,"" which really hit all the right notes for my own preference in Pinots. Gorgeous light ruby color, quite transparent. It has some bright cherry and herb notes on the nose, a little earthy. Palate is very nicely balanced, plenty of well integrated tannin, very bright acidity, fresh zippy red fruits and a good undercurrent of herbs and that wet leaves thing from a good Savigny Les Beaune. It needs the oak to lend a little bit of body, it's quite light. A touch linear, not going to confuse this with your good burgs or Willamette bottles, but I could easily blind call this a villages cote de beaune, Santenay, Fixin, etc along those lines. 13.5% ABV. 50% new oak for 11 months.

I really liked it, brought half a case home. Not cheap at $45 ish a bottle, but it's one of the best VA reds I've had. I'd give it maybe 90-91 points something like that. Check them out if you find yourself in CVille."

Well - how did it taste?
Very big on black fruit, high intensity and very well balanced. Well integrated tannins and medium acidity. Alcohol at 13% certainly noticeable. Vanilla in the background, some cedar and spices further away, typical Parker wine. For me itâ€™s slightly overpowered a bit like many Napa Cabs, which pushes aways the more subtle aromas that are certainly here.

Champagne Leclerc Briant MillÃ©sime 2010 Extra Brut,23,1g2yzak,https://i.redd.it/tfvlsvf92lud1.jpeg,4,2024-10-14 03:26:48,"
Picked this of an excellent wine list tonight as we felt like a champagne with a little age to go with poached turbot and bleak roe. 
I have been wanting to try this small house for a while but have hesitated in the past since I heard their house style is quite austere and can be a little out of balance. 

I needed not worry. This was beautiful. Perfectly balanced between the fresh acidity and brioche-y richness. Also felt like we caught this just at its peak. Both my partner and I got a strong hint of fresh orange on both nose and palate which was unexpected and beautiful. My thoughts went to Jaffa cake (minus the chocolate).
Looked this up later on Cellartracker and this is a rare instance where I disagree with the consensus there.

At $100 (tax+tip incl.) of a restaurant list, this felt like great value and I am glad I took a chance on this champagne."

I have read a lot about the growing reputation of Lebanese wines and Chateau Musar in particular. I have to say I have never been the biggest fan of the Austrian red grapes, but tasting blind can often alter perceptions.

Briefly talked to the winemaker, he also has a background in chemical engineering. Very promising.

We blindly bought some wines and tasted them at home. This was a gamble but we were confident because of the good impression we had of the winery.

No regrets! The buleza rosado is 100% mencia with some skin contact. It needs a small decant and then shows bright fruit, a hint of acidity and a very strong finish. Serious yet very easy to drink rose. This is what a good rose should be. Look at that colour!

We also bought the heredad 26 mencia and heredad 26 godello. While I liked the mencia, the godello is the star. It has a lot of depth while retaining freshness. I only regret not buying more.

We also have their top red, Rincon de heredad but did not taste it yet.

This is a relatively new project. Given the quality, pedigree of the winemaker, and prizes they already get, I see them getting more popular and expensive in the near future.

I used to live in Calgary and ordered from Zyn (as well as went in person) all the time. Free shipping, great selection, and prices lower than anywhere else. It seems like Zyn may ship to BC but I think it's technically against the law since it's coming from a different province.

  
I've found Marquis Wine Cellars but not much else. Any suggestions? Do I just need to plan trip to Vancouver?

  
The BC Liquor Store website has a great selection but unfortunately it doesn't let you order online or to be transferred to the BCL stores around me. I only lets me see stock around the province and annoyingly doesn't let me filter by what's available at a particular location. I've mainly been shopping at Jak's and the BCL in Penticton but their selection is fairly limited (and Jak's is pricy). "

The former was an oenologist with experience in Burgundy, while the latter worked at Domaine Hauvette (Provence) before becoming a sommelier and wine wholesaler in London.

Their interventions in the cellar are minimal, with short and light maceration for red wines and no use of new barrels.
This Pommard 1er Cru Les Poutures has been released under their label since 2017.

When first opened, the nose was austere, with gaseous sensations. But after a while, contact with air changed the wine, bringing out the fruit, leather aromas, and spicy notes. Time further improved the wine, and the nose clearly reveals scents of violet, raspberries, and licorice. On the palate, it is elegant with its light tannins and a nice refreshing minerality in the finish.â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹"

1. pour a bottle into a soft bottle, plastic pet or flask. do this the morning of travel and drink in evening.

2. use canned wine, never heard about it before actually. I live in the Netherlands.

3. strap the bladder of a boxed wine somewhere and bring this.(I feel like my options of choice of wine are limited by this when buying here in the Netherlands)

You also suggested that a 50 year old cab would likely not be very good and to have a backup bottle, so I went to the store and without realizing it, bought another cab from the same vineyard.  So we had a bottle from 1974 and 2020.  Fortunately, the 74 was actually pretty good.  The color had faded a bit, and it had lost ""something"", but otherwise was enjoyable.  I would equate it to listening to a song and turning the bass all the way down.

**Day 1:**
Schramsberg Vineyards, Chappellet

**Day 2:**
Quintessa, Stagâ€™s Leap Wine Cellars, dinner at Auberge du Soleil 

**Day 3:**
Chateau Montelena, O'Shaughnessy Estate Winery (personal connection)

What are the best wine guides for each region?,10,1goh3f7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1goh3f7/what_are_the_best_wine_guides_for_each_region/,3,2024-11-11 08:55:12,"I was wondering this at work yesterday. 

Iâ€™m a somm in Australia, usually if I have to make a selection for wines to consider and I havenâ€™t tried one Iâ€™ll default to Halliday to give me a rough idea of what to expect quality wise. Usually pretty reliable and really a great reference book as well.

When I look internationally, Iâ€™ve been using Suckling as my go to for looking at wines that I havenâ€™t had before and to be honest, I just donâ€™t agree with the ratings as much, lots of very average but highly rated wines, I feel like I just canâ€™t use it reliably as a resource for my job anymore. Also, not as comprehensive as Iâ€™d like as well.

What do you guys think are great resources for wines within each region? Like a great Spain or Italy guide, maybe even region specific like burgundy or Bordeaux. Specifically USA? Or South America?

Iâ€™d rather have 10 great guides then one just okay guide"

The cooked wine experiment ,11,1goekwq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1goekwq,4,2024-11-11 06:48:59,"Ever wonder what would happen if you left wine in a 110 degree room for 11 days? Well, let me tell you because this is exactly what happened to our friendsâ€™ wine. 

Their house had to go through water remediation and part of the process was to blast their basement with hot air machines, which unfortunately cooked all their wine. While the wine wasnâ€™t anything high end or fancy, there were certainly a couple of bottles which I was familiar with that I was definitely sad to hear were ruined. 

Nothing turned into vinegar or tasted like stewed fruits surprisingly. The main theme was that pretty much all of them tasted flat and smelled like nothing. They werenâ€™t disgusting, just veryâ€¦blah. Meh. Pretty much flavorless. 

The only exception was the 19 Crimes. It was terrible, but that probably wasnâ€™t due to the heat. The heat did seem to kill the nose, but I picked up some weird root beer, sarsaparilla, cream soda, cola note, definitely like fake sugary kind of note. 

On the palate, it was some kind of caramel and Dr Pepper with a hint of cherry robitussin. I almost spit it out because it was so nasty. 

It was honestly kind of exciting how bad it was, considering everything else was so flat. If youâ€™ve heard of movies that are so bad theyâ€™re good, this was almost like that, but with wine, and it wasnâ€™t actually good. But it was fun making fun of the 19 Crimes wine and very educational to taste the other wines that had been damaged by heat.

Oh - the Prosecco honestly wasnâ€™t too bad either, but La Marca isnâ€™t great to begin with, so the bar was pretty low, but it still had good fizz and didnâ€™t taste all that noticeably worse than a normal bottle! "

Spiced cherry, crushed rose petals, a touch earthy. 

Paired well with dinner which was farmstand pork chops with crispy shallots and garlic butter served with roast acorn and delicata squash and Brussels sprouts with sage brown butter and crushed roasted hazelnuts. A little homemade cranberry sauce on the side, too. Probably a Chardonnay would have paired beautifully but I saw Collotte Marsannay in the shop and had to. "

Petrus 1970.  Mid low shoulder fill.  Insanely depressed cork. I want so bad for this to be a miracleâ€¦

Haut Brion 1974 - Iâ€™d bet everything that this is toast. Never seen such low ullage. Iâ€™m still gonna open it up and smell it. Who knows? The bottle is a really interesting shape. 

Weingut Dr. Alex Senfter - nierfteiner Orbel Riesling Beerenauslese 1976 - this one has a nice looking level, but brown glass makes it hard to tell whatâ€™s inside.  Kinda have some hope for this one..

Beaulieu Vineyard private reserve 1971 - if only the petrus had the fill level of this one.  Decent cork and capsule position. Cellar tracker notes are not inspiring, but Iâ€™d be glad to open this up for science.

Porto Barros 1890 - I started shaking when I picked this one up haha. Not too familiar with ports this old.  The wax on the capsule is super crusty looking. The fill level is right to the top of the shoulder.  I have pretty high hopes for this one.

Offley Vintage Port 1963 - upper mid shoulder fill. Cork seems a little depressed. 

Out of all of these, I really want the Petrus and 1890 port to shock me. "

I'm a burgundy noob, so take my notes with a grain of salt.

Chateau De La Tour

Nose: Very balanced between red fruit, earth, tiny amount of spice, and a dusty note.

Palate: Very complex. Notes of spce, like black pepper, leather, tobacco, hints of red fruit. Very balanced. Also one unique note I can't describe, but it wasn't something I'm used to. Very high concentration of flavor, medium-high body

Finish: medium tannins, strong leather, dark chocolate, spice in the initial finish

Nicolas Rossignoe

Nose: More earthy on the nose, not much fruit, spice

Palate: Similar to the nose, earthy, leather, black pepper. Less concentration than the previous, slightly watery, but still very good.

Finish: Low tannins, but still present, slight amoumt of dark chocolate bitterness, good length

Two very good wines overall. I preferred the De La Tour, but these are basically my first two burgundies ever. Normally, we drink bordeaux, barolo, chianti, or Rioja and occasionally some new world wines, but not much Pinot in general. I did some research and found these wines over the past month and now I think I might have gotten some of my co-workers addicted to burgundy lol."

Wasnt familiar with the producer, but plenty of available info!Grapes harvested on September 7, 2019 - then 15 months ageing on fine lees. Stored at 55, popped and poured - no decanting. Paired with a grilled salmon and some rice.

Visually, a strong ruby color, hints of purple at the edge. Beautiful color.

On the nose, I went in expecting the usual red fruits of a gamay - was incredibly surprised to pick up herbs and spices reminiscent of the Southern Rhone! Less flowers than I expected. Deeper into the glass, blueberries - with a hint of the usual strawberries and cherries I expected. Fantastic scents for a gamay, I'm sure partly thanks to the terroir of this Cru.

On the palate - medium bodied, yet still refreshing to drink. A pleasant tannin grip, perhaps I should've aired it out a little - yet balanced, with a good bit of acidity. No notable burn at all (label shows it as 11-14% ABV? Wild LOL. Never seen an abv >range< before.) Dry. Flavors of blackberry pie, blueberry jam - bit of pepper at the tail end. The herbs continue - a fantastic bit of complexity at the price point. Nice long finish. This was $25?

My first Cote-de-Brouilly, and I'm absolutely blown away here. The nose, the palate - fantastic value here. Delicious in every way, and I cant wait to track down other producers. Highly recommended!!"

Great communication, and we ended up spending nearly three hours there. Seeing their horses, cellar, production facility, historic home, and vines was one of the highlights of our trip. The clarets and field blends were great and extremely interesting blends. The work theyâ€™ve done on their property and vines is evident in the product and the passion for what theyâ€™re doing.

One thing that's been occupying my idle brain since ages is defining objective criteria for wine quality. Not a single score, definitely not a list of aromas and flavors, but relatively easily measurable characteristics that would correlate with the ""quality"", i.e, serve as a buying guideline for an intelligent but not-very-well-versed-in-wine-yet human.

Say, my wife sees Chateau TrouvÃ© for 20$, Chateau Perdu for 200$, and Chateau Ã‰garÃ© for 35$ in a shop. She checks the notes and they are like ""... minty-edge to the cedar, tobacco, cigar box..."", ""... dried roses, mint, tobacco, dried cherries..."", ""... mint, smoke, cherries and raspberries..."" â€” absolutely unhelpful for her to make a choice (she grabs the one with the nicest label or the one with more medals). What I think would help her, or some redditors here, to make an informed decision, is to mention that, say, the bottle of Ã‰garÃ© for 35 bucks is better balanced and is a bit more complex than TrouvÃ© for 20$.

Not sure asking AI helps (yet?). For example, Gemini seems to care more about classification, reputation, and critic reviews, not to mention it often gets basic facts wrong.

With that, here are a few of my criteria to seed the discussion:

* Balance, both in main compounds (acid, alcohol, sugar, polyphenols) and in taste perception

* Duration of the aftertaste

* Complexity of the story the wine tells, e.g., ""light and fruity nose but surprisingly deep note of cherry that evolves into whatnot and becomes thisthat...""

What are yours?"

Paired with grilled lamb chops. Served a little cold (felt like 35-40), but warmed up as the night went on - not decanted.

Visually, a strong purple color - once I put my flash to it!

On the nose, bountiful floral scents at the rim - a bouquet of lovely fresh flowers on a spring day. Deeper into the glass, strong notes of ripe strawberries and cherries. Took a bit to open up - but I pin that more on the serving temperature than anything.

On the palate, fantastically crisp and refreshing, especially chilled. Lightly bodied, pleasant acidity, barely any notable tannin grip - par for the course with the grape. Dry, with perceived sweetness due to the strong ripe red fruit flavor more so than any actual sugar. That same nose of cherries and strawberries resumed on the palate, bountiful red fruit. Delicious, albeit no real complexity of flavor to me. Decent finish, and a great pairing with the lightly seasoned lamb and vegetable salad.

The bottle went for $58, but the host reduced it to $29 for me, and for a restaurant bottle at that point, I was definitely very satisfied with the value (since $58 gets me some good Big 4 Morgon). Took half the bottle home where it promptly didn't survive the night. Will happily continue pursuing Fleurie and the other Crus (eyeing a particular Cote de Brouilly for tonight)! Looking up the producer online, I was happy to see them using very sustainable and organic farming methods, which will have me choose them again soon. Recommended!

My question is, should I open a bottle now because it is time? Or should I wait 10 more years? Weird question I know, but I need a second opinion.

So far I've explored a bunch of red wines and figured out what I **don't like:**

1. Heavy, full, overly sweet reds (e.g. a lot of California reds like Zinfandel/Cabs)

2. Musty, chocolate, spicy, earthy tones

  
What I **do like:**

1. Lighter wines (leaning dry, but some amount of sweetness is nice)

2. Love love the chillable red wines

3. Floral/fruity scent/taste but not toooo sweet

4. Generally, I've found that the wines I like have a translucent/transparent reddish color? (like a french pinot/gamay?)

Color was a perfect red amber. Tobacco, black pepper, dark fruit, and tar on the palate. Well-balanced with a lengthy finish. Pleasant acidity. Pulled the original cork and re-corked with new, so I could use my Coravin. That's usually my move on these older bottles. Now I can finish the bottle over the next few weeks, with a small glass here and there. As an aside, I've noticed wines, while protected from ruin, do continue to evolve after tapping with the Coravin. So, I expect it will continue to improve over the coming days. "

Out of curiosity, I researched online if there are any licenses involved. As you might expect, I got a lot of different answers, but no real final say.
I did find some sources claiming that wine is considered food and, therefore, you need full-on food licensing.

So at what point does a wine tasting room need a food license?  Does anyone with experience in tasting rooms have the answer?

just had a lovely meal in Paris with a bottle of wine that was pleasant to start, but unfortunately became noticeably mousey within 45 minutes. I'm more than open to natural wines, and have served and sold many, but typically I'm more used to wines that turn around the second day mark and was unpleasantly surprised that this was so noticeably faulty before the mains even hit the table.

This got me thinking about the changes in the dynamics of wine consumption and how the industry reacts to it. The whole process of tasting a wine prior to serving is focused on cork taint... So while working as a Somm, I would accept a return from a guest where the cork taint became prominent over time (ie not noticed immediately upon serving to the guest), I don't know how I would feel about a wine that became mousey over the course of a meal... Conversely, as a guest, I didn't feel comfortable returning a wine that had become mousey (even though it happened so fast).

I feel like I'm rambling a bit, but I'm curious - if you're eating in a restaurant, under what circumstances would you return a bottle of wine that had gone mousey? Do you think mousiness is given more of a ""free pass"" than other taints? And if so, do you think thats fair?

Hopefully I'm not opening a can of worms here but I'm interested. Both as someone who is neither staunchly pro or anti natural wine, but also as a consumer who is usually on the other side of the interaction.

Appreciate your insights. Cheers."

Label on the wine I bought seems odd,5,1glwqia,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1glwqia,13,2024-11-08 01:02:07,"Hi everyone,

Quick question. I bought this 2016 Barolo online (through 8Wines). When it arrived, I noticed the label on it is different from all other pictures of the 2016 I can find online (1st and 2nd pictures are mine, 3d pic is the one I see everywhere else). Furthermore, this label advertises 16%, while I have read some reviews saying their label notes 15%. Is this something to be worried about, or am I being paranoid?

Thanks in advance!"

Quintessa: known for its long history of organic/biodynamic winemaking practices. 91% Cab Sauv and 60% new French oak. Dark berry fruit and granular, smooth tannins. Great acidity. 

Ornellaia: Bolgheri blend of 62% Cab Sauv, 31% Merlot, and a dappling of Petite Verdot and Cab Franc. Chalky tannins, earthy, tomato vine, and a jab of VA that improved with time in the glass. This one needs the most time to show itself out of all the wines tasted today. 

Chateau Mouton-Rothschild: lots of green bell pepper up front that integrated better with time in the glass. Angular, muscular, lots of personality.

I've got one more stored away and I think I'll plan to keep it until about 2030 based off tasting this one. 

This like most post 1990 disznoko is a spectacular example of what tokaji can be. I opened this bottle for about 15min and then decided to decant and start to taste after another 15-20min in the decanter. We ended up drinking it over the next hour. 

Upon starting to drink this it was extremely bright, lemon curd, dried apricot, fresh ginger, white peaches, and the trademark botytris funk. Still quite fresh and lively. Weighty and sweet but had substantial acid to back it up. Over time it got a bit more subdued on acidity and came really into balance and opened up to where I feel it was ideal after around an hour or so open. Towards the end of the bottle it did begin to lean a little bitter and flabby as it had started falling off. Still plenty of life left but definitely thinking it will be in its prime with only a quick decant off sediment before drinking with good company in 5-6 years. "
2009 Drouhin Oregon Chardonnay REVIEW,40,1gkosej,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gkosej,4,2024-11-06 10:05:03,"Updating from an earlier post, with my first review here on r/wine! 

Iâ€™ve slowly gotten into the wine world over the last few years, and working in the fine dining industry, Iâ€™m lucky to be exposed to a lot of higher level bottles and people who are amazing and willing to share. My first epiphany moment with wine, the sip that turned on the light bulb, was a 2010 Roulot white burgundy. I was so intrigued and so thrown off by the amount of flavors and textures and feelings that the wine thrust upon me, I didnâ€™t know how to react. Following this experience, I was sent into a two year foray into white burgundy and have found myself with significantly lighter pockets since. As an avid drinker of Nebbiolo and lover of Italy, I had sworn France to be overrated and dull. Boy, did this day prove me wrong! 

Ive been chasing that dragon since, and landed on Meursault and Pouilly-Fuisse, or more southern burg whites as my palettes choice due to the richness, creaminess, and more oak, as opposed to higher acid and steely-clean, crisp Chablis counterparts. 

Today, we have a bottle that intrigued me when I saw it, excited me when I got home and did some research, and blew my mind when I opened it. 

2009 Drouhin â€œArthurâ€ Oregon Chardonnay, found this among 4-5 more, covered in dust in a south Florida liquor store. Hereâ€™s my novice review so we can all get this over withâ€¦

Med-deep gold color, almost amber, gold flake and perfectly hued. Intense nose, flooded with deep, rich, and creamy apple orchard notes, little bit of flint, lot of brown butter and seriously (SERIOUSLY) heavy popcorn, but it was so good, no chemical traces, just organic pure old butter. Insanity. Wine was dry, weighty, but so well integrated, little bit of tannin (from oak maybe?) but it was so dang smooth. Medium acid, high alcohol, full body, intense flavor, crazy long finish. This wine is outstanding and was preserved so well! 
Iâ€™m going to buy the rest tomorrow. Overall 9/10 and blew my expectations out of the water. So balanced, so tertiary. Rich and smooth oak, toasted sourdough, kombucha and apples, buuuttterr, brown butter, more butterâ€¦. Lots of vanilla and little nutmeg, soft cheeseâ€¦ marmaladeâ€¦ man it just keeps going. Thanks for reading and if you see one of these, I canâ€™t recommend it enough. The age has done this wine such a service and Iâ€™d say this is its prime. "

Are there any information on the bottle, country, the price, the grape or anything that helps you decide? Iâ€™d imagine going for offers lets your money stretch to a better wine, but more expensive doesnâ€™t always equal better in my limited experience.

Has Port wine perception declined?,31,1gkdqum,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gkdqum/has_port_wine_perception_declined/,68,2024-11-06 01:34:59,"I'm from Portugal and have never been a big fan of Port, like most Portuguese. I think I can speak for the majority.  
It's been an overseas export from day #1 due to the fortification.   
All the terminology of styles is in English language rather then Portuguese (except for ""Colheita"").   
Its perceived as having a sort of an aristocratic personality.   
In reality none of those perceptions is wrong. But instead of attracting people, it scares them away.

I have the feeling that most people has not had a first good experience with Port. There's a lot of basic/cheap Port flooding the shelves and very little top tier cuveÃ©s or older blends...

  
I would love to know your opinion. How do you look at Port? Have you had a good/very good experience?

Have you ever thought of visiting the Douro region to get into Port. Or that's something now worthwhile for you?

Question for viticulturalists,1,1gkwsb5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gkwsb5/question_for_viticulturalists/,1,2024-11-06 18:56:17,"Is it possible to grow vines in such a way as to get the improvement in quality at a younger age?
As I understand, this improvement comes due to a bigger/deeper root structure and in general only after 15-20 years will vines start to approach their potential in terms of quality production.
My question is, if there are no constraints on the grower, can this be attained sooner? For instance, no irrigation and aggressive pruning to next to no yield, would this result in better quality wine, sooner?"

Black cherry and more earthly notes. Maybe even leather? Missing some nuance on the front end and really hitting heavily in the mid-mouth.

Outstanding persistence, good varietal character, just crunchy enough to let you know thereâ€™s cab franc and have it be a feature, still had a really lush red plum character without feeling overblown, great tension. I was over worried that it would be tired and popped and poured. Kept growing for hours. The cheval des andes was the star. Iâ€™ve had younger Malbecs that donâ€™t have the muscles this had.

The 2016 lâ€™enclos was insurance and not opened.


For food, I made beech mushroom toasts with magic dust seasoning from the hitching post and a red wine reduction. Those were aimed at the Pinots and paired well.

For the Bordeaux blends it was cheeseburgers with onion rings. Gave them smoke to 115 and then finished on a skillet. Seasoned with oregano, mushroom powder, sumac, basil, and nutmeg. Onion rings got hop cat crack fries seasoning. A little sweet. "

Visiting Jerez - Field Report & Recommendations,20,1gjonqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gjonqf/visiting_jerez_field_report_recommendations/,13,2024-11-05 03:41:28,"With Sherry Week kicking off today, I wanted to share my experience and recommendations from a trip to the incredible region of Jerez in early October.

**Background**: Iâ€™m based in Poland and got interested in Sherry two years ago through WSET 2. Earlier this year, I completed an intermediate course by Consejo Regulador Vinos de Jerez. I donâ€™t speak Spanish.

**Getting There**: Reaching Jerez is surprisingly easy. While thereâ€™s a small airport, taking the train is likely the simplest route, either from Madrid (\~4 hours) or Seville (\~1 hour).

**Getting Around**: The key bodegas (wineries) are in Jerez, SanlÃºcar de Barrameda, and El Puerto de Santa MarÃ­a. A convenient bus from Jerez (near the train station) goes to SanlÃºcar, and thereâ€™s a quick train to El Puerto. Iâ€™d advise against renting a carâ€”Sherry is fortified, and one tasting alone can be potent! Public transport is reliable, so thereâ€™s no need to drive.

**Arrival in Jerez**: We arrived in Jerez on a Sunday and stayed at a comfortable, reasonably priced accommodation booked through Booking. October wasnâ€™t crowded with tourists, and the weather was fantastic. The city is compact, very walkable, and filled with beautiful architecture. I wish I had more time to explore, but of course, the main goal was to drink Sherry!

The city is full of bars, particularly â€œtabancosâ€ (Sherry bars), where a glass ranges from 1â‚¬ to 5â‚¬. The quality is usually great, though there are occasional misses.

**Dining at La CarbonÃ¡**: On our first night, we had a reservation at La CarbonÃ¡ (https://maps.app.goo.gl/mJ411xqBpQS7KJ9X7), recommended by this subreddit. We chose the â€œLola CarbonÃ¡â€ tasting menu, which was 75â‚¬ per person and included 7 dishes paired with 7 different Sherries. Though there were some minor slip-ups (a shell in the seafood and limited English), the experience was a fantastic start to our trip.

**Exploring SanlÃºcar de Barrameda**: Early the next day, we took the bus to SanlÃºcar, a smaller seaside town with plenty of charm. Our first stop was Bodegas Hidalgo la Gitana (https://bodegashidalgolagitana.com/), which was incredible! The cathedral-like bodega building was awe-inspiring, and the tour was both informative and fun. For 19,50â‚¬, we tasted four Sherries, including two drawn directly from barrels with a traditional *venencia*. You even get to keep a branded glass as a memento. We left with a bottle of their Manzanilla Pastrana.

Afterward, we wandered to Bodegas ArgÃ¼eso (https://maps.app.goo.gl/YGtMGLEBheHYvbbP8) for a quick, free tasting in their shop. It was a good experience, though language was a bit of a barrier.

Our walk to Bodega Delgado Zuleta (https://maps.app.goo.gl/GXaJk9PvhGrDHRr29) led us to a pleasant surprise at Bodegas BarÃ³n (https://maps.app.goo.gl/zrCPuwmoGh5c84Vj9). Despite the language gap, the friendly staff gave us an impromptu tasting directly from the barrels. We ended up buying a bottle of their Manzanilla Pasada.

At Delgado Zuleta, we didnâ€™t have a reservation, but a kind staff member offered us a small free tasting. We sampled five or six different Sherries and bought a bottle of their Amontillado.

After a day full of tasting, we enjoyed a meal at Taberna der Guerrita (https://maps.app.goo.gl/qdwEh9vkcw4D6nuC6), another spot recommended here. The tapas were incredible, andâ€”perhaps inspired by all the Sherryâ€”we accidentally ordered bullâ€™s testicles! Also, be sure to check out their *trastienda*, a shop filled with Sherries.

**Sherry Museum at Bodegas Barbadillo**: We wrapped up SanlÃºcar with a stop at a small museum in Bodegas Barbadillo, which is worth a visit. Naturally, there was another tasting in the shop before we headed back to Jerez with five bottles in my backpack.

**Flamenco Night in Jerez**: That evening, we went to Tabanco El Pasaje (https://maps.app.goo.gl/WdU6Vhakca2TxiA4A) for a flamenco show. Although itâ€™s a popular tourist spot, the ambiance was great. We ordered a premium tapas set and enjoyed a house Amontillado that was so good we ordered another. The show itself was intense at first but very captivating.

**Touring the Iconic Bodegas**: The next morning, we visited Bodegas Lustau (https://lustau.es/en/) for a 30â‚¬ tour that included 7 Sherries (one VORS) and a vermouth. It was an amazing experience, and we bought a VORS bottle.

Later, we went to the renowned Bodega Tio Pepe (https://www.tiopepe.com/es-es/reserva). While the 24,90â‚¬ tour (4 Sherries included) was enjoyable, it felt a bit commercial with amusements like ""Sherry train ride.""

**Bodegas TradiciÃ³n**: Our final day began at Bodegas TradiciÃ³n (https://bodegastradicion.es/), which was absolutely outstanding. We received a private tour (as we were the only guests that day) with Ãgueda, who adapted her guidance to our deeper knowledge of Sherry. Afterward, we explored the ownerâ€™s private art collection, featuring Spanish masterpieces by artists like El Greco, VelÃ¡zquez or Goya. The tasting included two VOS, three VORS, and one Fino, all truly exceptional. This premium experience costs 55â‚¬ per person but is absolutely worth it.

**Final Stops**: Our last stop was Bodegas Fundador (https://brandyfundador.com/visita-bodega/), a large-scale bodega with a 30â‚¬ tour featuring three VORS. Afterward, we visited Vinos y Licores La Estrella (https://maps.app.goo.gl/aSXtcEMo37nSkkkr7) for a few final bottles before attempting a visit to the Consejo Regulador (https://maps.app.goo.gl/T7bcD9ZfdCJCZUh58), which, unfortunately, was closed during declared opening hours.

**Final Thoughts**: My trip to Jerez was unforgettable, and Iâ€™ll definitely be backâ€”maybe even next year. The region and its wines seem vastly underrated, which keeps prices affordable. And I still need to explore El Puerto!

**Bonus Tips**: If youâ€™re nearby, consider visiting Cadiz (a short train ride) and Seville. In Cadiz, GorriÃ³n (https://maps.app.goo.gl/NKt4MntEayq4EUfV7) is a great wine bar, while Baco Vinos (https://maps.app.goo.gl/mVEAHMfmXMtF8b3A8) is a well-stocked shop with English-speaking staff. Taberna La Manzanilla (https://maps.app.goo.gl/K9g5NUCgbu8VtzGj9) serves exclusively Sherries, many aged to VOS or VORS but declassified. In Seville, Vinoteca Lama La Uva (https://maps.app.goo.gl/55yxN3KHdSAu3o137) has an excellent selection and very kind, English-speaking owner, and Bar Casa Morales (https://maps.app.goo.gl/uxGHgZuVVxHSjUhQA) offers affordable, authentic, delicious experiences (the secret to get inside is to try all three different entrances).

Cheers, folks! Enjoy your Sherryâ€”not only this week!

Balade oenologique tasting package,13,1gjndkh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gjndkh,2,2024-11-05 02:49:17,"This is a tasting package of samples of BIO French wines. It's a blind tasting, you can read what you drank afterwards and they also provide tasting notes in French(see last images). I wrote my tasting notes before reading theirs, seems like for some of them we agreed for others not so much :) . First wine is no. 2, I forgot to take a picture of wine 1, it looked pretty similar to no 2 if a bit lighter maybe.

Wine 1
Sweet, apricot smell on the nose, as well as a bit of yeasty character and floral notes.
On the palate, quite acidic, and somewhat fruity, citrus with a bit of pear and apricot. Yeasty character persists on the palate.
Finish is more yeasty than anything else, lingering for a bit.

Wine 2
On the nose, pretty fruity, I think peach, yeasty notes here as well. The fruit persists on the palate, with a bit of a subtle thyme and oregano note going on as well, with the yeasty character here too. It also reminds me a bit of maybe a very fresh fruit tart? I don't know how to put it better. Quite savory, the finish is somewhat short. An interesting wine

Wine 3
A rose wine. On the nose, I'm honestly not getting much except for a slight floral note. On the palate, it's fruity, maybe some sort of red forest fruit, but again somewhat faint. The finish is surprisingly long and powerful, much more clear redcurrant than when you just taste it first. 

Wine 4
The first red wine. This is a light red wine, with musky and floral notes on the nose. Quite acidic, with light tannins. Body is thin. Definitely looks like Pinot Noir. I'm getting notes of cherry, plum and some almost tomato like savory note. In enjoyed this wine.

Wine 5

A much more corpolent red wine. On the nose, forest floor and redcurrant. Moderate acidity and tannins. Quite pleasant, easy-drinking but still somewhat powerful. I'm getting redcurrant and just berries in general. A bit of dried plum as well, especially on the finish. Finish is quite prolonged. 

Wine 6

A dark red wine. Pretty strong eucalyptus on the nose. Besides that, I'm also getting an almost cherry cola like note on the nose. Moderate acidity and somewhat strong tannins. The eucalyptus persists on the palate, being however complemented by cherry as well as dark fruit notes, such as blackcurrant and I think blackberry. Quite savory, long finish. Quite a complex wine, I really enjoyed this one.

"Have you ever advised, inserted yourself, or helped out an aging person with their wine collection?",6,1gjp4q4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gjp4q4/have_you_ever_advised_inserted_yourself_or_helped/,10,2024-11-05 04:00:37,"TL;DR - have you advised or helped out any aging wine collector population on the need to ""move"" wines, drink them, or get rid of stuff before it ages out? Even my healthy and hip Dad at 80 has a collection that isn't moving as fast, and I suspect we're seeing stuff die, and I feel like I should involve myself a bit.

\---------

I've worked my whole career in food and beverage in kitchens and front of house, then rooms ops and hospitality, eventually leading to design/build stuff, all since 1995. I've seen builds and helped with some wine rooms, in ideal and not so ideal situations. Then you move on... and old school inventory control still meant directors would ignore / miss some wine, or not sell it so it ages out and is no longer good. That's a bummer. It wasn't under my management, but I've seen some pretty stellar wine inventories get into disarray. It breaks your heart to see stuff turn or get ignored.

That being said, I notice baby boomers are both not traveling, nor eating or drinking, like they used to. Their cellars are full, and it's part of the ding the industry is having in re-inventing, modernizing, reaching new audiences, and competing with this temperance movement, weed, and interest in seltzers (the new Zima, Bartles and James, Smirnoff Ice, and this too shall pass). But they can't rely on boomers to buy, with as full as some of those cellars are!

But I do think there are a lot of personal collections that are turning. I mean, I'm 48 and I'm shocked what the pandemic did to my brain and time... I keep thinking a bunch of my collection is just 3 to 5 years old, and all of a sudden it's 15 years old, etc. So I realize there's a bunch of baby boomer collections that aren't being drunk as rapidly, and there are absolutely a bunch of cellars all over the world that just has turning or dead wines, and I want to know if any of you have done anything to prevent that?

I don't mean pilfering or self-interest, but have any of you helped a parent or friend by auditing a collection and sort of organizing what should be drunk or at least considered before it expires? How'd it go? 

I think this question might be extremely silly, so I might delete. Just curious if people have started seeing wine collections get ignored, sort of abandoned, and good stuff turning over time. Cheers all.

This wine had a garnet color with a vivid ruby rim. I picked up notes of black cherries, peppercorn, and cedar with a hint of flint.

2020 Sauvion Vouvray | More delicious $15 Chenin Blanc ,43,1givkes,https://i.redd.it/bynw0wqerqyd1.jpeg,5,2024-11-04 02:53:11,"Ah, Chenin Blanc from the Loire. My go-to reliable whites for casual drinking. I can never say no to a bottle when I'm out searching for more bottles, and at a comfortably priced $15 at my local wine shop, an easy purchase to try out a new producer. Stored at 45, popped and poured - to note, it's a screwcap! Sipped sans pairing on the first night, paired with grilled chicken and potatoes on day two.

On the nose, faint floral scents at the rim - honeysuckle and citrus blossom. Further in, familiar notes of grapefruit, lemon - surprisingly no stone fruit, as I would've expected - faint apple. The first night it smelled like an entry level Bordeaux Sauv Blanc (some melon waved hello) - but on day two, the scent was much more what I'm used to from the region. Strong citrus. 

On the palate, quite light - medium dry, so there is a tasty bit of sweetness. Not as much acidity as I would've hoped, a little restrained in that regard for my tastes. Also, at 12.5%, zero noticeable burn to speak of. In composition, a super easy drinker! Flavors of apples, lemon, lime - none of the nutty flavors I've grown to love in higher end examples of the appellation - very citrus dominant, like the nose. It's still in the mid 80s here in Florida, so a great white wine to enjoy chilled outside.

At the price point, I still favor Maison Darragon or Famille Bougrier, but it's still a good example of entry level Vouvray - refreshing and tasty. Recommended! "

Another producer from that region Filipa Pato, also recommanded.

Proud of their region, local grapes. 10 euro a glass at the bar, i guess 20-25 euro a bottle local price. 

So much flavour and freshness at the same time, low alcohol due to the atlantic ocean. 

WOW, also the same in Germany, France and Italy. Be authentic and dont mess around too much, wine without makeup is the slogan from Filipa Pato.

I was only in Portugal for 4 days, but it will get a more prominent place in my wine cellar."

I also don't think I've ever watched a movie with two main characters who were so unlikeable with 2 hours of just lying to everyone about everything. Maybe because I didn't see it new, that I missed the cultural zeitgeist that this movie did to Pinot and SBC wine country?

Kirkland 2023 Russian River Valley Pinot Noir,3,1gj5mdu,https://i.redd.it/6wney2a95tyd1.jpeg,6,2024-11-04 10:54:25,"Being relatively new to Costco, the idea of a serviceable weekday pinot noir (from the RRV AVA no less) for only $12 seemed intriguing.

Itâ€™s not as good as I hoped it would be, however, it managed to beat out the Belle Glos I reviewed a few days ago. Anywayâ€¦.

A little sweet for a pinot, and slightly heavier in mouthfeel than average, but for $12 itâ€™s not unbearably so. Itâ€™s just enough to remind you that youâ€™re drinking a mass produced pinot where some corners have been cut, and some liberties taken.

This is all red fruit, with cherry, raspberry, and strawberry. No dark fruit here to really speak of. Immediately following is the earthy notes of oak, smoke, and leather. Normally tasting notes of smoke and leather in wine is something that I absolutely love, but the residual sugar, vanilla, and heavier mouthfeel cloud over it all. Medium to medium-high acidity, although the slightly heavier mouthfeel impacts the versatility. 

Not bad, but also not something Iâ€™d buy as a weekday staple. This is a wine you bring to a party as an afterthought. I would drink this if served it, but this will remain a house party ice bucket bottle. 

My current weekday pinot staple remains Pacific Redwoodâ€™s Organic Pinot. At only $17 per bottle, Iâ€™ll gladly pay that small premium to get a much better product, even if it is usually a bitch to find.

On the palate, brioche, green apple, mandarin, lemon peel, lime cordial, with a bit of flinty minerals on the finish which is very long. 

Overall wanting a bit more on the nose but a very luscious and easy drinking champagne with a beautiful lingering finish.

92+ points.

1972 Taylor Fladgate Late-Bottled Vintage Port:

Deep copper in color, slight cloudiness and small amount of sediment.

On the nose, golden raisin, milk chocolate, caramel, cinnamon, dates.

On the palate, confirming the nose with hints of dried candied orange peel and baking spices.

A bit more diluted, and reflective of a somewhat weaker vintage but enjoyable nonetheless.

Oxidation, med amber. I see some viscosity as well.
I pick up dried orange slices, dried dates, mushrooms and cedar.
On palate, I want to say old strawberry jam, ginseng, and cinnamon.
Intensity I would have to say low+, low acidity, offdry, short.

I kept it in a small decanter to see if it developed any further, but nothing other than increase in acidity.  Before turning into vinegar, I made into a reduction to top on vanilla ice cream.

Chapoutier Condrieu Schistes d'Agrumes,2,1gj1m83,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gj1m83/advice_m_chapoutier_condrieu_schistes_dagrumes/,7,2024-11-04 07:23:30,"Just wanted to ask for a bit of advice. A liquor store has the wine in the title (2021), which is normally â‚¬42, but is now on discount to â‚¬31.50. It's still a bit of a high price for what I usually want to spend, but I'm willing to spend it on something I think I'll enjoy (e.g. last week I picked up a 2007 Colheita port from Dow's for a similar price that I'm thoroughly enjoying).

I'll explain my tastes so that you have more information to recommend buying/not buying a bottle. I tend to far prefer fortified wine, port especially, but I'm currently in the process of learning more about wine since I want to explore the wine world. I tend to prefer white wine over red. I (somewhat) like chardonnay, but am not a big fan of sauvignon blanc. In terms of red, the ones I like the most are pinotage and shiraz, but don't really like cabernet sauvignon. I also like procescco.

I received a hearty recommendation for Chapoutier from someone I know that very much enjoys wine, and tried a bit of pinot noir from Chapoutier, which was pretty good. That's why I'm considering this bottle. I also bought a bottle of CÃ´tes du Rhone and CÃ´tes du Rhone Blanc from Chapoutier, but those two won't be opened for now (since there are several open bottles that need to be finished first), meaning I don't have a base point of comparison.

Would you guys recommend buying the bottle? Sorry if it's quite a lot of text for what might be an easy yes or no for you, but I'm curious about the wine and don't want to potentially waste my money."

Best QPR in Piedmont?,105,1gid2u7,https://i.redd.it/pimtpk5zllyd1.jpeg,67,2024-11-03 09:33:50,"Reposting because original was removed. 

These are becoming my two go-to Barolos for highest QPR. The Vajra I feel is pretty commonly suggested to punch higher than the price. The Vietti is a staple producer and is hard to go wrong. For between $35-$45 itâ€™s hard to beat this. 

Do you have any suggestions that you feel are better for high QPR in this region?

Notes: I had these both earlier today so I have to  off memory so my post doesnâ€™t get removed. 

Vajra: classic brick Barolo color, bright red cherry, rose, tar, slight licorice. Medium high tannin, medium high acidity. Lots of fresh red fruit, well balanced. 92.

Vietti: Slightly more ruby than brick. Also lots of bright red fruit, tar, almost a meaty scent as well to it. Extremely smooth tannins balanced with a bright acidity. Well balanced and potential to cellar. 93. 

The 2020 year so far is close to 2019. Seriously a great vintage so far, lots of depth and potential to cellar. Still very young but the Barbarescoâ€™s and Langhe Neb are drinking beautifully now.  "

We let it decant and breath in the hope it would come back, but it didn't. We had the wine last summer when we visited the vineyard, and it was really nice there, but something had obviously happened in the meantime. I've not seen this in a bottle before, but it was coated in some kind of dark film up to the cork, and it lingered there after the wine was poured and the bottle upright, as if the bottle had been stained.

Firm texture I expect of Beaune with forest floor, dried flowers and a hint of barnyard all playing second fiddle to black cherries, macerated strawberries and raspberry notes. All bursting from the glass. Palate is also a mouthful of ripe red fruits with whispers of earth, flowers and spice. Finish is not incredibly long but sufficient to warrant this 1er cru's reputation. After about an hour in the glass, tertiary notes begin to take over and the age shows. The fruit doesn't disappear but it steps into the background for all the earthy funky floral notes to pop out. Onto the Sancerre Rouge. Obviously more a contrast than comparison but wow what a difference! Smoky, dark and brooding. My fiancÃ©, who's notes I love, said it smells like a pirate. Big, big nose wafting out of the glass. Blackberries and cassis, aforementioned smoke, baking spices. Almost smells more Rhone than Loire. Same on the palate. Full bodied, silky tannins, well balanced overall. Ripe fruit, complex secondary notes, long finish. Cheaper than the Burgundy, too. (I suppose that's a given these days.) Both paired quite nicely with Chinese food. (Pinot and Chinese is one of my go-to's.) Cheers!"

Napa Sauv. blanc - help me understand (and possibly help my marriage),13,1ghvs5y,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1ghvs5y/napa_sauv_blanc_help_me_understand_and_possibly/,41,2024-11-02 19:54:58,"Hello!

My wife and I made a trip through Napa valley this summer (first time!) and went to St. Supery based on a recommendation from a friend.  They are well known for their sauvignon blancs, which are spectacular.  We liked their wines so much we joined their club even though we're on the east coast.  We have not EVER joined a club before, so that's how much we liked their stuff.

Fast forward a bit, and we have received a few shipments.  One of these wines - specifically [this one](https://www.stsupery.com/product/2023-rutherford-estate-vineyard-sauvignon-blanc/) \- is causing a disagreement between us.  While the taste is still wonderful, the wine has a strong, pungent, wet wool, dirty sock smell.  It his me in the face...this is not a subtle note.  But, my wife doesn't smell it at all, and thinks I'm nuts.  Usually she's the one that's able to identify flavors and notes more than me, so this is surprising.  This has happened with two different bottles form two different shipments, so I don't think it's related to an anomaly in storage, cork, etc.

I have a few questions for the experts here:

1 - Is this smell unique to the one drinking?  Is this sort of a cilantro/soap situation where I can smell the odor, but my wife is unable?

2 - what can cause this odor?  I've read a few articles that cite the reason as either lightstrike due to improper storage, chemical contamination, or bad yeast.  But, this is above my paygrade to answer.  I can say that we store all the bottles in a medium size, temp controlled wine fridge in our basement.

3 - is this an intended characteristic of the wine?  We've tried a few of the St. Supery Sauvignon Blancs and the Rutherford Estate is the only one that seems to carry this particular nose.

Would love to hear thoughts from you all!

Obviously itâ€™s white and many serious wine drinkers for some reason constrain themselves to red. This was more restrained yet tense than any red wine Iâ€™ve tasted.

Is Franzia going under?,0,1gigii0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gigii0/is_franzia_going_under/,10,2024-11-03 13:05:49,"Been drinking the stuff for years now as my regular cheapo table wine (only reds) My favorites were ""Dark red blend"" and ""Burgundy"" Id sometimes buy there merlot or cab when the others weren't around. 

However, my ""totalwine"" store along with several grocery stores our suddenly out of stock on the blend and burgundy versions. 

I know its seasonal and the good and bad years effect the tastes over the years. But to be sold out completely? I recently read some wine article mentioning people are buying less mass market wines and this has effected its sales along with the growers in California.

I can only assume that this is a cut cost solution by reducing its products and probably phasing out certain brand styles.

Am I wrong here or did some catastrophe happen agriculturely? Just wondering."
"2019 Domaine de Montille, Beaune 1er Les Sizies",21,1ghmsbg,https://i.redd.it/pznwqr42ieyd1.jpeg,6,2024-11-02 09:39:25,"Fun bottle of Les Sizies, we suspected this may be in a dumb phase as we let it breathe for a few hours and it didnâ€™t give much but by the second glass it completely blossomed. The nose absolutely exploded from the glass with autumn leaves, spice, a hint of burg funk & really well integrated stems. The fruit character is really where the complexity comes around, this bounced between ripe cherries, black cherries, cranberries & raspberries all in various forms.. think luxardo cherries then immediately to ripe cherries etc. The palate comes across slightly thin with the acid seemingly carrying the structure. Overall gorgeous, elegant & understated but Iâ€™m not sure I see this going the distance. "

Dried figs, dark cherries and blackberries, with pleasant notes of undergrowth and mushroom. Quite advanced for 2018 and reflected the warm vintage.

I love red wine, but with *most* reds, my mouth and throat get very itchy after drinking it. I told my friends that I am allergic to raspberries, and they usually assure me that even though a red wine says it has â€œraspberry notesâ€, there arenâ€™t any actual raspberries in it. 

Right now, Iâ€™m drinking Firestone Vineyard Merlot and my mouth immediately got itchy. I looked up the ingredients, and sure enough â€” hint of raspberries. After all the research Iâ€™ve done, Iâ€™m still confusedâ€¦

Are there actual berries in red wine, or is the make up of the grape (or grape skin?!) the same enzymes as a raspberry? Enlighten me, please! Make it make sense! I love red wine :("

Open Your Wine Autumn - September and October roundup,13,1ghf6wl,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1ghf6wl/open_your_wine_autumn_september_and_october/,1,2024-11-02 03:33:43,"Some of you may have read my previous post on this topic, but for those of you just tuning in, Open Your Wine Autumn is a new tradition I have inaugurated which is exactly what it sounds like: A season-long excuse to open any wine that needs an excuse for opening, a yearly cure to the plague of ""waiting for a special occasion"" to crack that nice bottle you're sitting on for no compelling reason. As autumn calls to mind the natural cycles of aging and death, the wise wino, never taking life, health, or time for granted, knows to drink up while they still have the chance. Or, to put things in a slightly more grounded way: I get really bored of only ever opening 'responsible' weeknight bottles ad infinitum when I know I've got more exciting stuff sitting in my fridge, and I want to go a little apeshit for going apeshit's sake from time to time.

To that end I have put my modest amount of money where my mouth is and opened a few of the nicer bottles in my collection since September. I've done this on random weeknights, I've had them with burgers and shawarma and Popeye's and Chinese take-out, and I've consumed every one of them on my living room couch, mostly in pajamas. Since I've got until December 21st to keep #OYWA up I've not yet escalated to the bottles I've been most precious about (stay tuned for the December roundup for those), but I have dusted off the far reaches of my wine fridge and cleared out a good number of lovely bottles which had been waiting patiently for anywhere from 1-3 years for me to get around to drinking them.

In no particular order, here is the most recent batch of the wines I have opened so far this autumn in the spirit of OYWA:

\---

Alessandra Divella Dosaggio Zero Rose de Saignee NV - This stuff was incredible, I love good Franciacorta and having really enjoyed Divella's 'NiNi' at the Four Horsemen a year or two ago I was very excited to find another of her zero-dosage wines at a local shop. I didn't take very detailed notes on this ('strawberry' and 'yeast', ok, very helpful, past me) but with a bit of air on it it went from deceptively simple to absolutely screaming with flavor and aroma that'd make any grand cru grower champagne jealous. Not sure what the hell I meant by ""almost carnal"" but that's in my notes too? Fascinating color, a kind of rusty pinkish sultana raisin hue. World class Franciacorta, will be an insta-buy if I ever come across it again. This stuff begs to be paired with a meal; I think I had mine with fried chicken?

Catherine & Pierre Breton 'Les Perrieres' Bourguiel 2015 - This was a slightly shy Cab Franc that really wanted some time in a decanter to start expressing itself, but an absolute pleasure to drink once it did. Serious depth of flavor with your typical herby-peppery raspberry and earth accord, structured but easy drinking (""digestible"" if you like) at the same time. Had it with a burger and mac salad and could not have asked for a better pairing.

Chateau Simone Palette Rouge 2009 - Had been seeing this gathering dust for ages at a local shop and I'm glad I rescued it. One of those interesting southern French blends, mostly Grenache and Mourvedre with a whole hodgepodge of supporting grapes. Reminded me a bit of a Bordeaux at first with its strong red fruit-mineral-leather thing it had going on, but with sufficient air and warmth it started showing really interesting eucalyptus and licorice and garrigue notes. Really beautiful at 15 years and seemed like it would only get better with more age.

Olivier Horiot ""En Valingrain"" Rose des Riceys 2018 - I had the En Barmont a little earlier this year and loved it, and I liked this one even better. Fascinatingly 'textural' Pinot Noir, it has this kind of mercurial combination of density and lightness I find very hard to put into words; at the risk of getting too silly here it has a certain mysterious, magical energy and otherworldly tension to it. In any case I could drink a pail of the stuff; very tasty strawberry and sour cherry notes, herbaceous, a touch of cedar or pencil shavings. Really cool dark ruby color too, the kind of wine you want to look at with a flashlight. If those red health potions you drink in video games were real, this is what drinking one would feel like.

Domaine de l'Enclos Chablis GC 'Vaudesir' 2020 - One of my favorite white wines I've had all year, the kind of Chardonnay that just puts a smile on my face. I was enjoying myself too much to take detailed notes (I recall lemon, mineral, and smoke) but I did note that it was both serious and deep enough I wanted to take my time with it and also delicious and refreshing enough I wanted to neck a liter of it and ask for seconds.

Domaine de la Chevalerie Grand-Mont Bourguiel 2015 - I enjoyed this, although after having sat on it for nearly 3 years I was left wondering why I waited so long as it didn't really feel all that momentous. (That's the benefit of OYWA, I guess.) Interesting lychee black tea and barnyard notes which I find typical of this kind of low-intervention Loire Cab Franc, a bit of spice, raspberry, leather, plum, a bit of earth. Deep purplish-garnet color. If you've had Chevalerie's other offerings you can imagine a somewhat more structured, ageworthy version of those and you'll know exactly what you're in for with this."

In my mind CF is thin, light bodied. This could have passed for a zin or MourvÃ¨dre. Bone dry, high, grippy tannins. Light plum and current on the nose. Biggest flavors were leather, tobacco, dry leaves (maybe the Pennsylvania fall affected my taste buds). Each pour I enjoyed more than the previous. A lovely wine, biggest issue was how it tasted against my expectations, but no issues on its own. A nice drinking experience and it was fun to branch out and just enjoy being surprised by something. âœŒðŸ¼"

Now Iâ€™ve seen from this subreddit that some wines get better with age and others will just stay the same or degrade and that it totally depends on the wine. Will leaving a Madeira wine to sit for a long time make the flavour better? Or will it just remain virtually the same in all those years?

Also Iâ€™ve read they should be stored upright? Is this correct?"

Review: Belle Glos Clark & Telephone Pinot Noir,95,1ggsgoa,https://i.redd.it/q7t2w7efi6yd1.jpeg,56,2024-11-01 06:47:15,"Soâ€¦this says pinot noir on the bottle, but this does *not* taste like pinot noir. This tastes over-extracted and is syrupy in body/mouthfeel. Dark purple in color, much darker than a pinot noir should be. Needless to say, I can immediately tell this is heavily manipulated like Prisoner and Caymus.

Heavy notes of sweet vanilla, and oak thatâ€™s of an unnatural character. The fruit is a non-distinct mix of mostly dark and some red. I can make out lots of blackberry,  and some cherry and smoke.

This is neither elegant or structured. I would honestly look elsewhere for a quality pinot. It doesnâ€™t even taste that good generally. 

This ainâ€™t it. "

Nose: lots of lees-y, almost champagne-like brioche notes, citrus, and vanilla

Palate: very concentrated, expressive citrus notes (orange peel, lemon), well integrated oak (vanilla, lees characteristics), minerals, very long finish

Beautiful freshness really helps balance out the high alcohol (15%) and oak notes, gives it energy and acidic grip that melts into a long, waxy finish. Not usually a fan of big oaky whites, but that was very moreish. 

Got it on clearance and sad I didnâ€™t get everything they had.

Your favorite Aglianicos,5,1gh7yi1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gh7yi1/your_favorite_aglianicos/,6,2024-11-01 22:23:31,"So I recently got back from a trip to Italy, we were lucky enough to visit Rome and Naples and I made it a point to try some local wines. In my first couple days in Campania I had tried a Taurasi Reserva and another Aglianico and noticed both had a sort of bitter taste or bitter finish that I wasn't enjoying. On a trip out to Amalfi Coast we stopped at Ettori Sammarco, a small winery right on the coast in Ravello. Which I highly recommend stopping in if you're in the area. Very family feel, they have a little tasting counter in the winery and the founder/owner was right there overseeing the work and chatting with us. I believe he is 92 and still involved!I tried some delicious whites and some of their reds and fell in love with their reserve that is 70% Aglianico, 30% Pie de Rosso. It had none of the bitterness and everything I loved about the other wines I had tried. Talking with the host and the owner they mentioned there are multiple types of Aglianicos and the terroir of Ravello is part of why their wines don't have the same bitterness as others. 


I brought some bottles back that I'll sit on for a bit but I'm looking for other recommendations of Aglianicos that don't have that bitter note. As much as I'd love to order direct from Sammarco, ordering by the case with international shipping isn't in my budget at the moment (maybe as a treat down the road). I also get the feeling the other Aglianicos I tried may have been too young and those bitter notes may mellow out of the years. So I'm not opposed to grabbing some bottles to set aside. "

Guigal ChÃ¢teau d'Ampuis & Bellefont-Belcier Saint-Ã‰milion Grand Cru or a single bottle of  Guigal Ex Voto Ermitage Blanc?

I've been thinking about what to go with (I havenâ€™t had any of them before). Iâ€™m fairly confident about enjoying the reds; Iâ€™ve had Saint-Ã‰milion in a similar price range in the past, and while I liked it, it didnâ€™t leave a lasting impression (so maybe skip? save some money). Iâ€™ve never had a CÃ´te-RÃ´tie, though Iâ€™ve heard excellent things, and I know ChÃ¢teau d'Ampuis has a solid reputation. Iâ€™ve enjoyed Syrah based wines before, so I feel like it could be a good fit.

As for the white, Iâ€™m less familiar with white wines in general but have been intrigued ever since Konstantin Baum introduced the 2012 Ex Voto in one of his videos. The bottle available isnâ€™t a 2012, but Iâ€™m still curious to try it and have high expectations.

Sadly at the moment I don't have any information about vintages, but I expect them to be fairly young ones (towards latest releases if not the latests). It might also be important to mention I don't really plan on aging any of them, might not drink them when they come but soon enough.

So... what do you guys think? What would you go with?"
Salwey Oberrotweil Weissburgunder 2020,17,1ggpv0k,https://i.redd.it/6j147b8xv5yd1.jpeg,1,2024-11-01 04:41:09,"This Salwey Weissburgunder is an amazing expression of the volcanic soils and mineral-rich terroir of the Baden region. 

The aroma immediately captivates with a cozy campfire-among-flints essence. The elegant smokyness is balanced by lighter, fresher notes reminiscent of lemon zest and wildflowers, creating a cool tension between rugged and delicate aromas. 
On the palate, it has a beautiful unctuous texture like buttermilk floral honey but still with a bright and vibrant acidity and crisp minerality. 
It paired reallt nicely with creamy oysters and grilled lobster on butter-soaked bread. 
I found this wine really interesting and special and I canâ€™t stop thinking about it. I think Iâ€™m in love. "

I'm hosting a Burgundy-themed wine evening tomorrow, and I'm curious as to people's thoughts on whether I should decant the reds.

When I've previously hosted wine evenings, I tend to double-decant the reds a couple of hours beforehand, especially younger reds, to allow them to open up a bit. However, I've got a couple of older wines this time and I'm not certain if I should double decant them. 

Below is my selection of reds from across the CÃ´te de Beaune, CÃ´te Chalonnaise, and CÃ´te de Nuits (in serving order):

* Domaine Denis Carre Bourgogne Hautes CÃ´te de Beaune 2019,
* Moillard Volnay 1er Cru â€˜Les Santenotsâ€™ 2011,
* ChÃ¢teau De Pommard Clos Marey-Monge Monopole 2014,Â 
* Joseph Drouhin Rully 2021,Â

I donâ€™t think traditional tasting notes work for these wines, Iâ€™d have to tell you about the wildly high volatile acidity on the red and the almost too much texture on the white and we would fixate on that and never get to the important part. 

These are emotional wines, thereâ€™s not many producers that can make you feel as much in a wine as Kenjiro does, that doesnâ€™t mean the wines are easy by any means, I think most people would be surprised and probably not understand if they saw just how much VA is in the wines but then you taste them and the only reaction is to smile.

Not terribly well balanced.  For $20, itâ€™s not bad.  Iâ€™ve only had a handful of Barolos but they were properly aged.  I donâ€™t know enough yet to determine how good a wine would be after a few years in the cellar, this one might be a little better, but I donâ€™t think it will ever be fantastic.  Iâ€™d give it an 89.  I will post when I try the Super B.  "

I just turned 21 the other day and to mark my ability to legally purchase a bottle of wine I plan on buying a nice bottle of Bordeaux. I have done a ton of research over the past few months about wine, especially Bordeaux. I'm also pretty familiar with wine because my dad is in the wine business. If I'm being honest though, I'm just starting to appreciate wine, and I don't quite know yet what my personal preferences are. With that being said I want to buy a bottle of Bordeaux to start my cellar with. I narrowed my search down to 2 wines 2020 Figeac or 2020 Chateau Ducru-Beaucaillou. If I am going with rankings, WA gave the Figeac 100 points (My dad says WA is the best ranking followed by WS). On the other hand, I think the Ducru Beaucaillou is a little more elegant which I think is more my style(I just don't know yet for sure though). Another major criteria I have is which wine will be ready first. I would like to drink these wines within the decade. Does anyone have any thoughts? I do plan on buying a few other cheaper wines to get started but I wanted a nice bottle to store. Sorry for the long post I just don't know what direction I should go.

All these years later, we still had one bottle of that Late Harvest Symphony hanging around. After so many years, we assumed it had gone bad, but didnâ€™t want to toss it out, but also never had the desire to open it. 

Until tonight. 

Neighbors came over to celebrate my husbandâ€™s birthday, brought dessert, and I suggested this as the night we open the very old wine. And it wasâ€¦.

Not as bad as we expected! Not as good as we remembered, but it was drinkable.

The undercover star grape variety of whites?,38,1ge9eur,https://i.redd.it/0vm8fb47jjxd1.jpeg,15,2024-10-29 01:30:34,"Viosinho might be the most underrated grape variety in the most underrated region - the Douro, in Portugal.

This 100% Viosinho is very light in colour and crisp in taste thanks to its high altitude. Pear and pineapple nose, citrus and minerals in perfect balance with its high acidity. Ends with a beautiful long and lingering finish. Contrary to convention, the winemaker Joana MaÃ§anita decided to lay the stainless barrels horizontally.

Eye: deep garnet core, has become quite brickish. 

Nose: fresh berries, luxardo cherry, licorice, baking spice, cola, brine. 

Mouth: liquid silk. Medium bodied, tannins have completely integrated. Absolutely no harsh edges here. Bright cherry, dried herbs, lavender, tobacco, country ham. Long finish, good acidity. Finished the first glass far faster than Iâ€™m proud to admit: this is a wine that wants to be drunk. 

Wonderful experience, especially after being disappointed by younger bottles. Goes to show the heights that Virginia wine can reach if done with care.

I have roughly 40 bottles of wine, nothing insanely valuable, but some gems from Heitz, Dunn, etc from 2012-14. All of it is high-quality California or Oregon red wine that I hope to open in 5-20 years.

My fiancÃ© and I moved out of Denver this summer and left the wine in thermal fridge tote bags underneath a friends bed where itâ€™s roughly 69-71Â° in perpetuity and in the dark. We moved to Austin, and the moving company wouldnâ€™t take the wine. 

1) what damage is being done to the wine at that temperature? Itâ€™s been there three months. It is a mix of Pinot Noir and Cab Sauv
2) what is the most economical and safe way to get the wine to Texas?

The whole collection might be worth $5,000-7,000 - I am not really interested in high-end wine shipping, but I donâ€™t want to fly up to Colorado and rent a car to bring it down to Texas. I am considering securely packing it up and checking it on a United flight across 3-4 boxes. I am confident that a â€œfragileâ€ sticker and proper packing would ensure its safety on the plane to about 99%. I could also just tough it out and rent a car one-way and make the drive, costing me probably $600 in plane, gas, and car rental.

The structure was quite robust but completely velvety, this was gorgeous but the absolute icing on the cake came at the 2 hour mark when it really started to show a Rocky minerality & distinct notes of sea salt (think salted chocolate).

I thought this was just an American thing that by imports/marketing Riesling has a reputation of being â€œsweetâ€. But even in Europe, people also seem to have this perspective in my experience.

With spicy Indian food you say, how inappropriate. This was only used during early appetizers, and have to say the spices counterintuitively did not overwhelm the wines.

I am relatively new to wine and havenâ€™t developed great vocabulary for what I am tasting, but I loved how â€˜crispâ€™ the Gramercy Cellars was but still had a depth of darker fruit almost savory taste was. The Unnamed Series was great because it felt like over the course of the evening like I was drinking 3 separate wines. When I first opened it it had the same crispness I liked in the Gramercy bottle, but then changed to an almost smoky flavor. After about another hour the smoke gave way to a really delicious funky fruity wine. Really great stuff. 

All of this has made me extremely curious about other Walla Walla producers. My first question is: in my researching these bottles I have noticed people say rocks Syrah has a distinct funk. I am assuming thatâ€™s what I liked in the second bottle. Do other grapes besides Syrah exhibit this funky flavor from Rocks producers? My second question is i am looking for recommendations for wines similar to the ones i described.

Over the last year or so, Iâ€™ve really gotten into liking wines, reading about them and tasting them - but only whites. Mainly because I prefer whites, but also because I have an easier time distinguishing notes and differentiating the wines. I especially find Rieslings interesting, as the wines are incredibly versatile (I love crisp Riesling from Mosel, especially ones only harvested and made 1-2 years ago). NZ Sauvignons are also a favorite of mine (I prefer crisp, acidic, fruity and dry whites.) 

But reds just seem so much more difficult and hard to grasp? Where do I start? What grapes/areas? Also the notes and palates - for some reason I just do not find it as easy as smelling/tasting them on whites. How do I get going?

"Self-afflicted psychological allergy of alcohol, possible?",0,1gdxicf,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gdxicf/selfafflicted_psychological_allergy_of_alcohol/,8,2024-10-28 15:59:37,"If this is not the subreddit for this, then I am sorry and this can be transferred/deleted. I only visit this subreddit and donâ€™t really know where else to post this, and this is something I am really struggling with.

Â 

I come from an environment where drinking is considered normal. This goes for not just my family, but basically everyone I grew up with. Parents of friends down the street, social gatherings like birthdays, diner parties. Ever since I was a kid, almost all the adults in my life drank alcohol. A considerable portion of the friends I have now, also like to drink. Not all are heavy drinkers, but if I am being honest it feels like I am verging on the edge of alcoholism myself and I know for a fact both my parents are and have been alcoholics for a long time.

Â 

What â€˜kept me in the darkâ€™ for a long time is that no-one around me really seemed to be compromised in their daily lives because of this life-style. Functioning addicts (not all of them, but still), so to speak. If I am being honest (again) I also donâ€™t see the problem in drinking whatever amount if itâ€™s someoneâ€™s choice and it doesnâ€™t come with harmful consequences for that person or his/her surroundings.

Â 

However, someone really close to me has developed a condition which really has damaged the way I view this person, and at time makes me want to cut him/her out of my life for good. Thus, the reason of this post.

Â 

Is it possible for some-one who has been drinking all his/her life to develop a sort of allergy of alcohol?

Â 

The person I am referring to may be having a pleasant conversation with you, but as soon as the first glass of wine is consumed things take a turn. The visual aspects of someone who is completely drunk are recognizable immediately (which is â€˜too soonâ€™) but even worse, the personâ€™s whole character seems to change. The same anecdotes are told back to back. Mean verbal jabs are made. His or her opinion on things are really extreme, but seem to be completely random, like the real â€˜he or sheâ€™ is completely gone.

Â 

It's just like the tolerance is completely gone, and a sort of super random auto-pilot takes over. I know it sounds like I am describing someone who is black-out drunk but like I said, this occurs after just one glass of wine, and this person has been drinking all his/her life. Can you drink away your tolerance to the point you are just a completely different person?"

So fresh and precise still this could go longer easily.

Triolet 2020 - Less salinity and complexity, this was a challenging vintage. Similar lemon and lime but also a little grassy yet a little brighter than the 2015. Citrus galore on the palate, however feels thinner and less complex. 

Triolet 2022 - The standout for the Triolet here, this one is so well integrated. Has complexity beyond the 2015 and also tastes older than the 2015. Zippy yet creamy and well balanced. 2022 is a great vintage.

Chardonnay 2020 - Buttery and rich on the nose, refreshing salinity and yellow fruits. Still great complexity for this challenging year. 

Chardonnay 2021 - Like the 2020 but more fresh, more acidity and more fruit forward. A buffed up version of the 2020.

Chardonnay 2022 - Okay so what a vintage for the whites this is, so complex and drinking well beyond its years. This is a standout and so well integrated already, this would be exciting to revisit in 10 years. 

Marli Russell 2021 - A new endeavour by Mount Mary focusing on Rhone varieties grown and vinified at the estate. Big red fruit nose, core of strawberry and jam, smells like a farmers market. The palate is light and fresh with strawberry, cranberry, light as a feather, wow! Young Grenache vines so itâ€™s less concentrated fruit and lacks the earthiness you expect from a GSM. 

Marli Russell 2022 - This one has darker fruits, jammy plum and boysenberry, very brooding on the nose. Palate similar to the 2021 but more concentrated fruits. 

Pinot Noir 2021 - Very excited, my favourite Australian Pinot, feels like its weightless on the nose, dark red fruit core, porcelain on the palate itâ€™s so delicate, floats effortlessly with a trio of strawberry, slight pepper and vanilla pods.

Quintet 2014 - Deep and concentrated, blackcurrant and boysenberry with dried vanilla pods. Dark and ripe red fruits converging on a medium body. 10 years on and could still go a long way! 

Quintet 2017 - More liquorice and pronounced red fruits compared to the 2014, I get a little eucalyptus too. This one could almost fool me as Margaret River in a blind tasting. 

Quintet 2021 - Lost the eucalyptus note entirely, more earthy with deep red fruits with much more concentration. Excellent balance, great oak and vanilla perfectly integrated.

Quintet 2022 - More vanilla pronounced, thinner body on the palate but fresh and vibrant still with ripe red fruits."

In the privileged position of being a semi-retired physician with time including for travel, and have some capital. I would become a wine ""professional"" just to do this. I'm banned by my luckily more-sensible wife from starting or investing in a hobby winery so what else could I do to work or contribute to the wine world? I currently help a friend in her warehouse winery as needed but it needs to be a real role (i.e. 20+ hours a week). I'm in Australia.

It doesn't have to make money. I doubt the world needs more amateur wine writers. Ideas I've had... I could go in as an investor if a friend with industry experience starts a wine bar. Non profit? I have lots of contacts in the Middle East and could do something somehow helping winemakers in marginal areas?? Doing boutique imports is probably the easiest to initiate from a mechanical point of view but sounds capital-intensive, low and possibly negative margin and generally a pain in the ass unless I actually tried to scale it up. Would involve tax-deductible travel and probably good home drinking in direct proportion to sales failure but I'm under no illusions as to the glamour (my father shipped industrial material around the world and it seemed very painful).

Any ideas?

First time trying old wine (Lafite 1988),138,1gckn96,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gckn96,40,2024-10-26 20:05:04,"Tried 3 different vintages of Lafite during the Decanter Masterclass in Singapore. 

2018 was very tight and tannic with primary fruits dominating both the aroma and palette. Can see how the wine will be elegant and great in the future. 

2008 was more advanced but still had great structure and started to show more softness but still had the primary fruit core. 

1988 was the one that made me go â€˜what the hell!?!?â€™ The first sniff I took almost made me gag. The barnyard funk was so strong that I thought I put my head into a pail of horse shit. Honestly, Iâ€™m not sure if this is representative of what older Bordeaux wines taste like. But it was quite revolting. The speaker remarked that we have to look past the barnyard funk to see the underlying tertiary notes. At this point, I was seriously questioning if the wine was corked or spoilt but it was my first time trying a 30+ yo wine and everyone around me didnâ€™t say anything so I didnâ€™t want to raise any questions lol. 

For those of you whoâ€™ve tried this vintage in recent years or have had experience with much older Bordeaux reds, is it common to have such a strong barnyard funk (smelling like horse shit)? Personally I didnâ€™t find it enjoyable so idk maybe itâ€™ll be something I have to experience more to appreciate. "

We are both fairly new to wine and haven't delved too much into the Old World. We loved how much we learned about the process and grew a much deeper love and respect for wine. 

The 1993 Vouvray, we only bought because that is our birth year and it was only 6â‚¬. It was the oldest white that I have had and it was a lot in the mouth. Tasted like I took a mouth full of dirt and chased it with some mushroom water. Definitely wasn't a favorite. 

We weren't in Bordeaux long, only 2 and a half days and only got one wine tour in at St. Emillion. I wish we would have been able to spend more time in this area as there was more things to see and wine to try than we had time for. 

This is the haul that we came home with. Our main goal was to get a bottle with the intention to save it for our 15 year anniversary. We chose the 2020 Chateau Martet. We loved this wine when we tried it at the shop. Had the tasting notes of dark cherry, vanilla, and licorice. 

Happy with our haul and can't wait to go back!"

Initially super strong and high tannins, but mellowed out and fruit notes came out.

Notes of cherry pits, raspberry, strawberry stems, aloe vera, green peppercorn, orange skin. 

Definitely a powerful wine, doesn't taste hot, but you can tell it's strong from an alcohol perspective.

Paired well with spicy vegetarian nachos. 

I love this wine, it's a tiny notch below the Shakti, but that may just be age. 

As a bonus, saved half a glass for the next day and it opened up even more! Would definitely decant for a minimum three hours before touching this.

Just wanted to share a few pics of the Port Capital of the World: Duoro. This place really needs to be seen to believed. The slopes that hold the port grape are steep and rock solid. Slate and Shist rock battle for the grape vines of Pedro Xemenez and many other varietals. The people of the Duoro are lovely, hard working, life long devotees of their task, climbing these rocky slopes with wine baskets to harvest these grapes. 

After touring most of the wineries, my favorites are Sandemans and Dow, but other smaller, less well-known producers are also fantastic. 

I cook with 10 year tawny (pork with red wine vinegar, safe and port are my go-to) and drink 20 and 30 year tawny. 

If you love Port, make it a point to visit this beautiful region. It's well worth the long drive, side of the road, precipice gazing at the vertical slopes and amazing cellars of these vineyards. Cheers!

This isn't likely to be super expensive stuff, and I'd be keeping things for around 5-10 years, not decades. As an example I recently bought 3 cases of Chateau Teyssier (Montagne St Emilion) 2019, at a cost of EUR12/bottle which I expect will improve over the next 5 years. 

I've previously dabbled with home-brewing beer, and ""made"" a temperature controlled fermentation chambre using a tried and tested DIY approach: a fridge, with a small 60W tubular electric heater placed inside, the fridge and heater both wired into a thermostatic controller which turns one or the other on to maintain the temp within a set range. For home-brew this was around 19-21 degrees C, but it would be easy to adjust this to say 12-15 degrees C.

I'm wondering if something like this would work rather than spending Â£100's on a purpose-build wine fridge (esp. given the type/value of wine I'd be storing).

This beauty comes from the Eisenberg region of the southern Burgenland. Wachter-Wiesler are a well established producer from there, making BlaufrÃ¤nkisch in a terroir-driven style that focuses on refinement and freshness. The wine hails from the Weinberg vineyard in the village of Deutsch-SchÃ¼tzen. It has a souther exposition and its soil consists of iron rich clay. After spontaneous fermentation and spent 34 months in a large oak casks.

I aerated the wine for about 1 1/2 hours after opening and served it in a Spiegelau Definition Bordeaux glass. It has an opaque ruby colour and garnet rim.

On the nose the wine presents itself with dark fruity aromas at first, think of luxardo cherry, sloe and plum. Soon after, more savoury notes take control, hallmark notes of Eisenberg BlaufrÃ¤nkisch like blood and iodine come through immediately. The wine then also presents notes of crushed stones, undergrowth and black pepper. Furthermore, a well integrated hint of barnyard funk, citrus and earth envelope the wine.

The palate shows intense fruit of sloe and dark cherry at first, minerality and earthy notes come through as well. A very fresh acidity and structured, but not overpowering tannins add structure. A long finish brings the wine to an end, showing notes of luxardo cherry, meat juices, leather and herbal tones.

Another Eisenberg-banger after the Weninger Saybritz for me! It shows a perfect interplay of fruity, savoury and lightly spicy notes at this point of development. It also has still a lot of life still in it, so extended aging would also be an option. If you enjoy BlaufrÃ¤nkisch of this style, definitely give it a try!"

Ideal Wine Cellar Inventory According to Little's Law,23,1gcbvpu,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gcbvpu/ideal_wine_cellar_inventory_according_to_littles/,13,2024-10-26 10:13:37,"Little's law is a quick way to determine the optimal number of widgets in a process, whether it is a part in a manufacturing process, or a bottle in a wine cellar. 

The law says that the number of inventory items during steady state is equal to the average processing time (holding period) multiplied by the consumption rate.

Steady Inventory = Holding Period X Consumption Rate

For example. If I consume 52 bottles of wine per year, and I want to cellar each bottle for an average of 5 years, my ideal cellar inventory is 52x5=260.

More than 260 bottles means I won't consume enough before they age out, less than 260 means I'm consuming more than what my target holding period will allow. 

It's a simple way to perform a gut check for the ""how much is too much?"" question regarding how much wine to buy and cellar. "

Story: in the early 1990s we planted a beautiful rolling 68 acres site to Chardonnay here in Carneros in the cool southernmost part of Napa Valley it established our vineyard using sustainable farming practices. in 1994 we harvested our first fruit. this vintage celebrates 25 years of wine produced from the Chardonnay grown in our spectacular sight. 

Taste: round smooth almost perfect if it jumped out to me more. Cream, citrus, butter but not in a bad overoaked way. Itâ€™s balanced itâ€™s sturdy. Itâ€™s strong. Low acid, brioche lemon zest. Honestly such a balanced good wine itâ€™s hard to describe. 

Price: free but retails around $70 bucks think

Points: 94 I think. Itâ€™s honestly just so pure and smooth idk what to rate it. Itâ€™s such a good easy wine. If I could give this to someone to who says they hate California chard itâ€™d 100% change their mind. "

Baron de Philippe Rothschild Tasting,89,1gbyih2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gbyih2,9,2024-10-25 23:34:07,"Today I had the wonderful opportunity to attend a trade tasting of the estates of Baron Philippe de Rothschild. Pictured wines start with Petit Mouton, then Mouton â€˜09, then â€˜05, then Barsac â€˜08.

Here are my notes, with an albeit stuffy nose :(

Pastourelle de Clerc Milon 2020

meaty, austere, drinking well for its age. slight herbaciousness
88 points

Ch Clerc Milon 2018
More fruit than 2nd label, soft tannins, has 2% Carmenere which is very interesting .
94-95 points

NOTE: after tasting through everything in this wild lineup, the value/QPR of Clerc Milon really stood out to me!! I wish I took more detailed notes on this.

Ch d Armailhac 2015
soft nose, but not extremely expressive. fruit was there but a bit one dimensional. long lasting finish. 93 pts

Petit Mouton 2010
dark color, but the garnet is starting to appear on the edges
nose not as pronounced but came out a bit - likely just needed to open up
palate was fantastic. black cherry, dark fruit, slight graphite, vanilla,  tannis were present and a bit grippy. meaty and vanilla finish. this wine is about to enter its prime, if it isnâ€™t already. finish was long and enjoyable. 
95-96 pts


Mouton Rothschild 2009
color: still dark but the tawny look around the edges
nose: pronounced, black currant, dark and lightly stewed fruits
mouth: extremely silky, balanced, slightly warm, pronounced cherry, fresh vanilla, looong finish - creme brulee, vanilla, cherry. lasted 10 minutes if not longer

the finish specifically developed in my mouth - i wish we decanted!
97 pts - but i think if this was decanted it would reach 98

Mouton Rothschild 2005
dark and tawny color
nose: stewed fruit, some vanilla, toasted nuts
palate: fresh fruit on the edge of the palate that morphs into a somewhat stewed fruit on the center of the palate. still a good structure - this wine is in its early prime (for my palate) tannins are present and silky, but  leaves a grip that wants me wanting so much more.

97 pts - also probably needed a decant


Personally, â€˜09>â€™05, but they were both excellent.


Chateau Coutet Sauternes-Barsac 2008
nose: pear, citrus, ginger which allows the flavor to pierce through the nose
palate: the candied ginger is so awesome on this. it has all your classic sauternes notes, but the way the ginger makes this so unique has me really happy with this.

A Warning about RareStorage (K&Ls shipping affiliate) ,27,1gc6bha,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gc6bha/a_warning_about_rarestorage_kls_shipping_affiliate/,14,2024-10-26 05:17:52,"Update: I usually hate this kind of thing, but I donâ€™t want to put any business on blast if they donâ€™t deserve it. K&L left me a voicemail informing me they have refunded me in full. 

I was really happy to learn recently that K&L had a shipping affiliate that shipped to other states than CA. They're called RareStorage and the shipping rates seemed really reasonable. I filled up a couple cases of wine, paid for shipping and insurance and since then it has been a nightmare. 

They shipped my wine through GLS, who proceeded to drop my wine off in a different state than the one I live in. Now, nobody seems to know where it is, or when it will get to my house. K&L can't really help, although they have tried and their customer service is excellent, but RareStorage is a separate company. RareStorage won't talk to you on the phone and so you rely on email correspondence. They provided me with a new tracking number yesterday that was incorrect which further complicated things. I contacted GLS, who has assured me twice now that their operations team will contact me. That hasn't happened.

To K&Ls credit, they have really tried to help, but it seems their hands are tied. It also sounds like RareStorage uses different shipping companies for different states, so you could get lucky and have your wines shipped via UPS or Fed-Ex depending on your location. If you're considering having wines shipped through RareStorage, I would first inquire about which shipping company they'll use to get the wines to you. Also - for my state, there was not an overnight or 2 day shipping option. That probably should have raised red flags in itself, but by the time I realized that, it was too late. 

I know plenty of people here have had good experiences with K&L, and this really isn't their fault. But I did want to give the community a heads up that their affiliate is less commendable and your mileage may vary, depending on where you live. "

New to wine in general, brought back two bottles of champagne from a recent trip I was hoping to store for five years. Can I just vacuum seal the entire sealed champagne bottle and shove it in a normal fridge? I was reading that normal fridges get too dry which is bad for the cork and keeping the storage trouble free. I was thinking that by vacuum sealing the entire bottle it would keep humidity steady even in a normal fridge. The other solution I thought of was maybe wax dipping the top of the bottle which I would think would make it a more consistent humidity level.

I know nothing, y'all know a lot. Please help a brother out if you have a minute. I did try searching around in the sub but the closest I found to an answer was talking about slowing/stopping the aging of the wine using a vacuum bag, which is not what I'm looking to do. I'm just trying to safely store it. I like in a pretty temperate climate, but our house will see some days in the 50s and some days in the high 80s and I don't have a basement."

100% Chardonnay

Medium yellow to light golden in color. 

On the nose: candied pineapple, mango, rice cakes, peach, saltine crackers, white flowers, balsa wood and dry stone. 

Medium to medium plus body, rich, unctuous, close to if not bone dry, medium acid but still pleasingly crisp, with notes of unsalted popcorn, yellow apple, Asian pear, fresh unripe pineapple, clementine skin, and chalk. Very slight tannic grip from oak aging, and overall the oak here is forward but well integrated. Intensely long finish with green apple and white nectarine, toasty oak. After about 2 hours of air, additional secondary notes of toasted almonds and cinnamon come through towards the finish. 

A gorgeous bottle of white wine and very solid example of the Chassagne-Montrachet style.

60% cabernet franc
20% cabernet sauvignon
20% merlot

16 months barrique

Can age for another decade, needed air, tannins kick in, black currants, pencil, spice not a polished easy wine but can compete with left bank bordeaux.

I always look for the best import price, and it was 21 euro, normally 27-30. 

Label is bit ugly. But i will buy more for my cellar to age a bit.

I'm looking for tips, tricks and/or tactics for remembering wine details. 

I have just started as a somm and am finding that it is difficult to get all the details locked down for the wines. I am expected to remember the winemaking and tasting notes for all of the BTG and Pairing wines but I keep getting things mixed up or just can't seem to lock it into memory.

 For example, Elk Cove Pinot Noir comes from 6 sites that are fermented separately in stainless steel and blended then matured in French oak for 10 months, using Pommard and Dijon clones. Then I'll have Hartford Court Chardonnay from Russian River Valley in Sanoma that is barrel fermented with 28% new French oak and aged for 9.5 months with weekly lees string and goes through full malolactic conversion. 

  
Two very different wines, made in very different ways but when I have to remember those details for 20, 30, 40 plus wines I find that I get aging times mixed up or the blend mixed up and so on, especially if the wines are similar. 

  
Wondering if anyone out there has ideas for how to get these things memorized. Event if its seems simple, I am just trying to pool different ideas I could adopt.

However, I canâ€™t seem to find recommendations or â€˜literatureâ€™ on which producers to look for for good white Burg and what producers I should try to experience good Burg red. I am not really in the position to go splurging an grand cruâ€™s, but I am just curious what the experts of this subreddit would suggest.

TLTR: What Burgundy producers are known for their whites, and what producers are know for their reds?

Is stem inclusion in Pinot Noir the new overly-oaked Chardonnay?,37,1gbcdlg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gbcdlg/is_stem_inclusion_in_pinot_noir_the_new/,32,2024-10-25 03:22:16,"OK sorry for the clickbait title. 

But seriously, has anyone else feeling like there's been a huge increase in noticeably whole cluster fermented/stem included pinot noirs lately? I know it's not a new technique by any means, but in my memory it used to be something that added an extra je ne sais quoi to a vintage that maybe needed some help with complexity, not hit you over the palate stem-y chewy. If the first thing I notice when tasting a pinot is if it's had stem contact or not, IMO it's gone too far. Specifically on American pinots, which I get a fairly broad exposure to through work, feels like recently the volume has been turned up to 11. Maybe my palate is just super sensitive to it and no one else is noticing this trend. Do I need to start a ABSCP (anything but stem contact pinot) club to join the ABC club?"

Casanova di Neri & Tenuta Il Poggione were decanted for 2.5 hours before drinking and the Le ragnaie was poured out in the glass and we started drinking it after 45 mins .

to me the winner among these wines tonight is definitely the casanova di neri , come close at second place , le ragnaie 2019 which did not opened up as I hope during the night 

on the nose the 2018 casanova di neri is simply beautiful ,notes : plum , cherry , oaky , chocolate , tobacco , spice  , tannins are very well integrated .

ended the night with a bottle of Tokaji i brought back from my trip to Budapest , sold by Faust Wine Cellar . I have not tasted alot of tokaji or dessert wine , but this bottle is absolutely delightful to be paired with the pandan swissroll . perfect ending to the night

35th Birthday Party - what am I pulling from the Eurocave?,19,1gb66la,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gb66la,67,2024-10-24 23:02:40,
My Mt. Etna experience and the regionâ€™s parallels with Burgundy,182,1gateoa,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gateoa,35,2024-10-24 10:31:16,"I just got back from Sicily for my honeymoon, and as part of the trip that I got to plan we visited two wineries: Benanti and Girolamo Russo. Both had fantastic wines with great tour guides/somms that took you through a flight of 5 or 6 of their wines. What made the latter visit extra special however was getting to experience some of the harvest of their Nerello Mascalese grapes. 
As you might know, things go a little differently in Europe and you canâ€™t just stop by unannounced at the tasting room, you need to email them and reserve a time slot for a good 2-3 hr or longer experience likely to be paired with multiple courses and/or walks through the vineyard. 
Benantiâ€™s wines and historic production house turned modern showcase are impressive, with a large old wooden press and art adorning the rooms that had a sort of royal, medieval vibe to them, only surrounded by lava rocks. We tasted a beautiful sparkling metodo classico brut Rosato (that they no longer make or at least sell and distribute past 2020), a contrada bianco, a 10 yr old Nerello Cappuccio, and 2 more reds including a 2011 Serra Della Contessa, probably their most prized vineyard boasting centenarian vines behind the property on the side of a SE facing hill. This was all paired with thoughtfully paired food courses for each person. We didnt have the Pietra Marina, but I left with two 2019s after reading and hearing first hand how ageworthy it is.
Girolamo Russo is a newer winery with their own unique story that I wonâ€™t get into here, but the tour was incredibly special. The woman leading our experience let us work the sortable table before taking us through each of their main vineyards by having us follow in our rental car within the different contrade, or sub zones. We eventually walked up to their current tasting room if you can call it that, for their entire lineup including a metodo classico and pet-nat I didnâ€™t know they made. All these wines were just as impressive, each having their own character depending on the contrada they represented. 

After touring the vineyards I remember being struck by all parallels to Burgundy: the lava rock walls surrounding all the vineyards, much like a clos; thereâ€™s many different producers working in the same contrada, and Mt Etnaâ€™s wines are extremely elegant and mineral, with red and white expressions made from mostly single varietal grapes (especially the higher end bottles). I even remember thinking I could totally mistake Girolamo Russoâ€™s San Lorenzo Bianco for a high quality 1er cru Chablis. When I mentioned some of this to our somm she replied, â€œyou know they call it the Burgundy of the South!â€ She wasnâ€™t kiddingâ€”after looking back at the World Atlas of Wine, Jancis Robertson says â€œSome see it as the new CÃ´te dâ€™Or, and vine holdings are similarly parcellated.â€ 
Thereâ€™s a lot incredible wine there, with many relatively newer wineries tending some diverse and exciting terroir. And if you love bubbles, especially rose, thereâ€™s amazing QPR to be had there too! Vintage bottles of metodo classico brut rosato aged on its lees for 2-3 years can be found everywhere in shops for â‚¬25-30"

Snagged this at auction and have been excited to crack it! This wine is a blend of around 75% mourvÃ¨dre, 14% grenache and smaller amounts of cinsault, carignan and syrah (shiraz).

An enticing pale ruby colour. The nose is very aromatic with fruit cake, dried figs, cherry, and olive brine supported by an earthiness with some mushroom and lager.  

A light body with some light acidity right out the bottle complimented by very fine chalky tannins which dissipate over the second pour. Immediately getting sour cherries with strawberries and red currants. The secondary earthiness is also present with that great mushroom and cured meat which gives it that classic French savoury feel. Dark red fruits emerge with some air and are persistent through the finish. 

This is delicious, I fuck with Bandol, especially this cuvÃ©e."

* Preference for blends over single varietal
* Aged whites are worth looking into for more interesting
* If it's some weird (not popular) grape variety, it's worth a shot
* I usually limit my regions and countries so I don't have too many variables so I can know what to expect a little more flavor wise - as regions within countries can be so different (like South Africa)
* Usually my budget is $20-35

Despite my being able to find no flaw - everything was in balance, the tannins were pleasant, acid was appropriate, and they made no mistakes such as being too fruit-forward or having a weird finish - this wine made me bored. 

What can I tell you about its character? Nothing, I could not detect any. The nose? Your basic Bordeaux nose, albeit in more restrained intensity than I expected.

Decanted for about half an hour and then drunk over the next hour, it might have opened up given more time but it didn't ""feel"" like a tight wine waiting to uncoil. 

I'd happily drink it anytime it was offered, but I think I will forget this wine sooner than I'll seek it out."

2017 has an unfair rep as a ""bad"" vintage, but I think 2017 Brunello from good producer is still good Brunello and, very importantly, pretty ready to drink now. This isn't for aging over decades (save that for the 2016s and 2019s).

Initially pretty tannic, but with air, really opened up.

Notes of red cherry, red plum, chestnut, soil. Over time, the fruit notes came to the forefront.

Really lovely wine that could benefit from further aging, but is already approachable.

93 points.

Daniel Rion & Fils Vosne-Romanee Les Chaumes 1er Cru 2017

Ready to drink now. Needs a little air, but not heavy decanting (although I did decant it).

Very fruit-forward Bourgogne, ripe fruit, bright cherry notes. 

Nose is almost perfumey with floral notes of rose and cherry blossom. Almost reminds me of my wife's perfume. 

Drinking lovely now.

92 points.

Very fun experience and would drink both again any day of the week! "

Thereâ€™s a beautiful floral character as well, with hints of potpourri and violets. Subtle spices of vanilla and pepper, alongside a touch of cinnamon, create a layered complexity, while refreshing notes of mint and licorice add intrigue. I love the playful hints of orange peel and candied zest that linger in the background.

On the palate, itâ€™s a true delight. The wine is full-bodied yet effortlessly elegant, with well-integrated tannins and vibrant acidity that make each sip a pleasure.

Are Vinotemp wine fridges still considered a good budget pick?,6,1gamejh,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gamejh/are_vinotemp_wine_fridges_still_considered_a_good/,7,2024-10-24 04:49:28,"I saw this 157-bottle Vinotemp for sale at Lowe's for just $630 - nothing seems to be even close to that price for a similar capacity. I'd heard some reports of failure after a couple years in general for this brand, but I'd think any brand besides Eurocaves carries that risk - if it lasts even 6-8 years I'd consider it a win for this price. The side-loading bottle layout could also be problematic for some bottle sizes, but even staggering bottles the capacity should be sufficient for the price.

There was some drama about 5-10 years back about Vinotemp putting a non-disparagement clause in their purchase agreement, but it seems to be gone now - and I'm not sure how they could enforce it when buying through a third party like Lowe's.

Explosion of red berries on the nose. Like a smoothy of raspberries that is deliciously inviting. Background notes of sagebrush and dessert shrubs but really the raspberries stole all my attention.

On the palate, you immediately think bright red fruits that give a full mouth feel but without making you exhausted with it being a typical CA red wine. It was bright and lovely and balance with a nice acidity. The finsih went on for days, like a treat.

Overall it's a classy example of Anderson Valley pinot noir. Really love to drink on its own but I snacked on some charcuterie and truffle cheese, which was perfect.

94/100. I regret I didn't pick up a second bottle.

I'm from Germany, specifically from the Riesling region, where wine is a big part of the culture. Funny enough, I noticed pretty early on that I can't really handle wine. Where Iâ€™m from, itâ€™s common to mix white wine with water to make a refreshing spritzer, so I didn't think much about it growing up since it was always diluted.

As I got older, I moved away from white wine and started trying red wines, but soon switched almost entirely to beer after spending some time in Bavaria. Now Iâ€™ve realized that whenever I have just one glass of wine, it gives me stomachaches and gastrointestinal issues that last through the next day. At first, I thought maybe it was an alcohol thing, but I can drink two liters of beer without any problems.

Has anyone else experienced this? Could there be something specific in wine that causes these issues? Or is it possible that beer, with its anti-inflammatory compounds, helps counteract the effects of alcohol on my stomach?

Any insights would be appreciated!

What was unique was it undergoes spontaneous fermentation in steel tanks then undergoes fermentation in the bottle ""using the ancestral method without disgorgement (sur lies). No filtration, stabilization, or clarification."", according to their website.

Stefano Amerighi syrah 2021,18,1g7gxud,https://i.redd.it/csplpjwtnrvd1.jpeg,24,2024-10-20 02:42:42,"I hear a lot of people saying this is the best syrah outside France, so i thought i could get some shit making a post about it.

Premises: 
-I'm not a syrah connoisseur so i'm not compairing this with other wines but i'll refer to basic stuff i know about this variety, so feel free to correct me.

-I decanted it because it felt extremely closed after i tasted it and i didn't have time to see how long would have taked to open leaving it by itself. (Explanation for the non americans that don't decant every liquid contained in a glass bottle /s)

Since i pass by cortona very often for work, i went to this lovely winery to grab a couple of bottles.
They finished E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G. They've got nothing till next April. They kindly redirected me to a nice local grocery shop that had some. Lucky me

The winery is byodinamic and they say in the back label they press the grapes with feets. (Yummy)

Sooo, great color, deep dark ruby with violet shades, nonetheless, it leaves light pass through its body even enancing the brightness, when put under a lamp.
Less viscous than i would expect.

While smelling the cork i've got a strong hint of licorice that wasn't so dominant after.
In the glass the wine wasn't particularly intense, i could't properly discern many of the aromas exeption made for obvious violets, maybe some red roses, blackberries, ripe plums, sour cherries under spirit and the weakened hint of licorice.

In the mouth it felt very unbalanced, a strong acidity covered most of the wine's body. Alcol, low viscosity and sweetness weren't balancing the hardness of the wine.

I decanted it for about an hour, during this hour i sampled it and i might have smelled something a bit off one time. No trace of that after pouring at the end of decantation.

Now the nose was good: hint of tobacco added to the width of the wine, some fruit switched a bit on the jammy side and the sour cherry lost the alcoholic tone that was a bit too penetrative on the first try.

Mouth got the best out of it. Obviousely the acidity lowered and left space to some of the best tannins i've ever felt: smooth, silky and well integrated, i almost wanted to have more of em.
At this point the alcol was doing his job, supporting the sharp oriented body of the wine, so the low viscosity could leave you drink this well bodied wine like an easy pinot noir. Majestic job from the winemaker.
Finish was long enough, not something out of the world

The empty glass left a lovely, proustian for me, blackberry jam scent.

Few sediments were left on the bottom of the decanter.

I paired it with polish veil steak, dry-aged for 35 days and my 2 days old olive oil.
I was scared the dry-aging might have made the meat a bit too hematic and intense for the wine but it worked like a charm. The body of the wine integrated with the strong meat flavor and the acidity cleaned the greasiness of the fat and the oil, leaving the soft tannins and the animal flavor for long on the tongue.

30â‚¬   great, great wine. 95-96 points (93-94 imho) only took away points for complexity, equilibrium and intensity.
I didn't consider the sediments since they weren't it the tasted glass and gave max points for visual look. Maximum points for quality on both nose and mouth even if i'm not conviced about that. I think suckling gave it 98pt (wtf)


Ok, but why i didn't like it enough?

-In the end the acidity lowered but was still a bit too much, you could taste the greatness of the wine but idk, you had to kinda look at it through a window(?).
It needs few more years on his back, i hope the rest of the body won't lose anything

-I read about people saying this wine has great complexity. That's not what i call ""great complexity"".
1 flower and a half, 3 dark fruits and licorice is not complex, is the average note of a rich newbie tasting Petrus.
What are you gonna call a wine with 10 well defined deacriptors and hints of tar, vinyl and leather?
Even konstantin baum sais it has some flowers, blackberries, plum and pepper (that i don't actually percieve here and he explains why that's pretty common) and then proceeds to sing the praises of the great complexity of this wine. Am i missing something or that's just as wrong as it seems to me?

-I admit it just isn't my genre of wine lol.

What a stunning wine. This taste way more expensive than a Bourgogne should/could taste. Opened last night and continue to drink today.

Smell of red berries not as light as strawberry more like cherry and leather very approachable from such a young age.

Taste of spice and a cherry and acidic of a very fresh minerality, reminded me of why I love pinot. After 3 recent bottles of Bourgogne rouge I have drank in the past 2 months(not posted here because it didnt really impressed me as much). This is great.

From my experience, I have had way too many Bourgogne rouge that is just too breathless from being way too young. I think Bourgogne rouge should be approachable from release. Why would I have to wait for it if I also have to wait on village, premier cru and GC."
Gewurtz Going The Distance: 2009 Barmes-Buecher Gewurtztraminer Rosenberg ,24,1g7btvg,https://i.redd.it/dovnwj79iqvd1.jpeg,7,2024-10-19 22:49:31,"This is my first post about a specific wine on here so take it easy on me as I try to work on my tasting notes. 

I've been a growing fan of aromatic white wines with Alsace being chief among my go-to regions. I recently returned from my second stay in the area last month and decided to seek out some interesting wines back here state-side. 

I've not had the opportunity to visit Domaines Barmes-Buecher in my travels to Alsace, but it is definitely on my short list for a potential third trip. This particular bottling comes from the hills to the south-west of Wettolsheim, which is just west of Colmar. I absolutely love the older style label, it reflects much of the character of the region, even of it is a little marketing unfriendly. 

Onto what ended up in the glass: PnP initially and let it develop in the open bottle over the course of the evening. Deep gold/amber color, floral, honey and dried peach aromas. Flavors of honeysuckle, candied walnuts, dried peach, apricot and lychee. Medium long finish with some herbal spice and lasting sweetness. 

I had some initial concern about the age of this bottle vis-a-vis it's lieu-dit status. While a Grand Cru Gewurz could easily go for this kind of age, (or Trimbach's Seigneurs de Ribeaupierre) I wasn't sure about this producer's style, the individual terroir, or how much RS was there to help this expression along. This ended up being a treat, and I'm further convinced of the underrated ability of Gewurztraminer to age, at least when it is of the opulent Alsace style. "

I'm a huge fan of half bottles, they let you enjoy a glass of nice wine without committing to an entire bottle. Perfect for a glass at home before going out for the night.

Stood up for a few hours before opening. Needed a Durand to open, there was some discoloration on top of the cork. Thankfully, cork didn't crumble and bottle was totally fine, no cork taint, no brett.

First sip was actually ready to drink right away, tannins weren't harsh at all. But decided to slow ox for an hour before drinking, then drank over the next hour.

Over time, developed notes of dark plum, blackberry, dark cherry, rosemary. On the palate, medium acidity and nice long finish. Tannins definitely mellowed out with age. 

Shockingly, this paired very well with spicy pongal (a South Indian rice and lentil based dish). Another reminder that Indian food can pair really well with the right red wine, even though restaurants continue to insist on sparkling and semi-dry whites as the right pairing. 

I'd say this is squarely in the drinking window. I think there are years ahead on this, but I don't expect it to get better with time. 

I have one more half bottle left and intend to enjoy it in the same manner within the next two years.

Help needed! Recognisable wines to be featured in movie?,0,1g7bjam,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1g7bjam/help_needed_recognisable_wines_to_be_featured_in/,20,2024-10-19 22:36:01,"Who are some â€œrecognisableâ€ producers?

Perhaps a slightly wacky question, but I need you, Reddit hive mind!

This is for a movie project Iâ€™m working on. The movie deals with generational divides and similarities at large, which is illustrated through various avenues, one of which being food and wine.

There are two subplot characters who get in a whole thing walking through different wine stores/looking at wine lists (probably the former but possibly the latter), with the younger character being super into natural wine and the older character being into (everyday) classics. For the natural wines I have a list already, including bottles like some Pheasantâ€™s Tears from Georgia, Bonhommeâ€™s Telquel, Meinklang Weisser Mulatschak, Gabrio Bini, Tissot, Matassa, EnvÃ­nate,â€¦

My question is: what are the equivalent producers in conventional winemaking? So not Barefoot, La Vieille Ferme, 19 Crimes, or Yellowtail, but what are some labels that the audience would recognise both visually and as good, solid (maybe even outstanding) bottles?

The AligotÃ© La Charme Aux PrÃªtres 2019 is ready and floral, with its aromas of citrus, grapefruit, white pepper, and a very light note of vanilla. The oak is expertly managed by Sylvain Pataille, who proves to be a great winemaker. On the palate, there's a distinct minerality that pairs well with a nice salinity. The finish is very long.
A great white wine, after all, it comes from one of the best crus of the appellation.

The Maranges 1er Cru La FussiÃ¨re 2020 is exceptional. In my opinion, the Domaine is among the best in the appellation. It can already be drunk now. On the nose, it's elegant with notes of wild strawberries and cherries, followed by a sensation of pomegranate, then flowers along with a clear balsamic note and mint. On the palate, it's smooth with its small silky tannins. The precise fruit melds with iodine notes and an elegant minerality. Long finish.

Colchagua Valley Cruisin',121,1g64iob,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g64iob,25,2024-10-18 06:30:21,"I've spent the last two days driving around Colchagua Valley in Chile and wanted to share some of my experience. I did some hurried research before this trip, but based on what I saw on this sub, there's room for more info to be put out there for the benefit of anyone thinking about a tour.

First, some logistics: Colchagua Valley is about a 2:30hr drive from Santiago Airport. Renting a car and making the drive is pretty easy - drive on the right like in the States, tolls are almost all taken care of electronically (like EZPass/SunPass) and are included in the rental price. Have some cash in case you find a booth that requires it. Be careful of surprise school zones with accompanying speed humps in the middle of a 70kph road.

There are a few towns that serve as anchor points in the valley. I stayed at a lovely hotel outside of Santa Cruz, Hotel Noi Blend. Super quiet in the middle of the vineyard fields, but not part of a winery. 

If you look at a map, you'll see a crescent-shaped mountain range just northeast of Santa Cruz. I basically did a lap around that. The landscape is beautiful with the Andes in the distance, and it's generally a fun drive.

I hit two wineries because I arrived in the afternoon Day 1, and Day 2 was kind of a trek. I booked in advance with Clos de Apalta (sister label of Lapostolle, actually their premium label), and ViÃ±a Vik. Both times, it was just myself and my wife on the English speaking tour. This seems to be an area more frequented by Latin American tourists. I would HIGHLY recommend knowing some Spanish, because almost no one speaks English outside of Santiago. I'm not saying that as a demonstration of anglophone privilege, it's just a fact this far away from the English-speaking world.

Winery impressions: Clos de Apalta was beautiful. They clearly care a lot about their process. Instead of steel tanks for fermentation, they use MASSIVE 7,500 liter oak barrels that they change every few years. Annual production is 20k cases. Lapostolle uses steel and cranks out 120k. The 7-story gravity system is some pretty remarkable engineering and really worth seeing. They also claim to have the oldest Carmanere vines in the region dating back to 1907.

ViÃ±a Vik has a bit more of a haughty air. Steel tanks everywhere but under a very impressive building. They import precut French oak to build their own barrels, which they then smoke with Chilean oak for a more subtle flavor. It was a cool process to see, but not quite the ""ooh-aah"" that I got with Clos. Their restaurant was very fine dining with a prix fix menu at $75pp, which includes two glasses of wine.

Wine impressions: I found out that I really like Carmenere! It's a brighter grape on the tongue but has lots of depth to it. I'm not an oenephile but I do have something of a palette, so I'll try my best here. Clos Apalta had three wines that we tried. Le Petit Clos 2020 was fun, everyday drinkable. It's the ""little brother"" of their major eponymous wine. Clos Apalta 2020 and 2012 were next. Even the guide agreed that the 2020 needed more time to mature. The 2012 was definitely a FULL expression of Carmenere, almost too much. Overall, we thought they were all delicious but would've aged the 2020 more.

ViÃ±a Vik had us try straight-from-the-barrel pours of Cab Sav and Carmenere to get a handle on the grape. Then we tried Milla Cala (our favorite), Vik the namesake, and La Piu Belle. Milla Cala was again, fun and drinkable. Not something you have to sit there and ponder over, but something to be enjoyed in the moment. I hope that makes sense. Vik was heavy and required time to chew on. Crazy long finish. Piu Belle was nice, but we tried their rosÃ© during dinner and that was SO much better. Overall, I think ViÃ±a Vik won the tasting contest.

Anyways, I hope this helps anyone looking to head out that way. It certainly opened my eyes to the better possibilities of Chilean wines. And there were TONS more wineries to explore, so I'll have to come back. Cheers!"

Can minerality come from unwashed grapes?,11,1g6h6i2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1g6h6i2/can_minerality_come_from_unwashed_grapes/,59,2024-10-18 19:45:12,"Hey guys!

I'm new to studying wine (I've done WSET Level 2 and CMS intro and I'm currently studying for both WSET 3 and CMS certified). I keep getting hung up on the concept of minerality. I know minerality in wine is a highly contested topic, the main argument being that grapes will not absorb the flavors of the soil they are grown in simply by being grown in them. Of course, this argument makes sense, but I'm having difficulty accepting that there is absolutely no correlation, given how certain wines do have minerality which can be percepted (even being able to differentiate between salinity, wet rock, limestone, flint, etc). 

After realizing most grapes aren't washed before fermentation, the logical conclusion that keeps coming into my brain is that the flavors are imparted from the organic matter left on the skins of the grapes.  I mean, if I dunk anything in salt water and then eat it, it should have a hint of saltiness, right? If I seasoned a piece of meat and left it to marinate for a few days, even if I rinsed it off before I cooked it, there should definitely be a lingering presence of the seasonings, no? I feel like this is definitely an over simplification that should have been mentioned and disproved by now, but I'm having trouble finding anything that talks about the difference washing grapes can make on flavor- everything I find focuses on native yeast and the effects on spontaneous fermentation. Please let me know if there are any materials (lectures, books, etc) that mention this/if I'm going crazy

Thanks!"

Champagne type choice?,4,1g6iqgw,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1g6iqgw/champagne_type_choice/,14,2024-10-18 20:59:53,"When we were married we were given bottles of champagne, nothing fancy but those 'higher end supermarket' wines. There was a Moet, a Taittinger and one other I cannot remember. 

We opened one with the birth of each child and it became a mini tradition. Now we are having our fourth (and hopefully final haha) child and I wanted another bottle to continue the tradition. I was very tempted to go crazy and buy something like a Krug GC 171 but it's very hard to justify when I probably wouldn't appreciate it.

So I want a decent Â£50-100 bottle of 'celebration' wine and came across Eric Rodez wines while searching for options and they sound nice. 

The problem is that there are loads of choices (sweetness levels, BbB, BbN etc) and I have no real experience of selecting champagne. I generally prefer complex red wine but my wife prefers sweeter white if that helps (yes we are opposites). What bottle should I pick?"

A birth year gift to my brother from Uncle Sandyâ€™s cellar. Opened with low expectations, pleasantly surprised 

Soft cork came out with very little fight, a bit crumbled so decanted

Ruby center, red-orange rim

Surprising amount of fruit still alive in the nose with cherries, prunes and a hint of past its prime age that follows, almost a dusty/earthy scent. Dried flowers. 

Palate: a bit of tar up front, fruit behind, stems/stalks/earthiness. Faint oakiness which is more like Bamboo cedar than a vanilla. 

Not a classic Pinot noir flavor from my experience.

The entire Dutch side is coming over and everybody expects me to handle the wine. I thought it would be nice to try some American wines over there as they are a bit overpriced and also rare on this side of the pond. That's why I was hoping people could give me some recommendations, preferably available for shipping to Florida. I am not a fan of topheavy overripe raisinny or oxidative wines, US wines I have tried and loved are Sandhi and Evening land(Raj Parr fan I guess). So slightly reductive, fresher and more nuanced/elegant styles I guess. Your recommendations would really mean a lot to me as US wine really is a bit of a blind spot and people on this subreddit seem so incredibly knowledgeable about them! I put the categories I'm looking for and some ideas I have had below. 60$ is not a hard limit but if I can keep the average around 50 a bottle I would be very happy.

(Edit: I find US wines to be a bit overpriced in the Netherlands specifically, there are many markets where they are great value and even some offer exceptional value in my country, just to be clear I am not a hater.)

Categories I'm looking for(and wines I am thinking of):

Sparkling: No clue :( I like a lot of lees and blanc de noir is generally a plus

Light white: No clue :( Big fan of Saumur Chenin, Silex Sancerre, Timorasso, Aligote or basically everything. Have not often liked new world Sauvignon Blanc though, tends to be a bit fruit heavy. Family doesnt like Riesling which is sad. Really not too aware of American whites outside of Chard and SauvB so anything cool/niche that comes to mind would be great!

Big white: Sandhi Santa Rita Hills Chardonnay(have not tried other bottlings), Bodega Chacra Mainque(found a good price am open to US equivalents)

Light Red: Evening Land Eloa Amity Hills Seven Springs Pinot Noir

Big Red: No clue :( I specifically do not want Cabernet or Merlot, was thinking some Syrah or GSM blends would be cool any other recommendations also more than welcome! Something structured with vibrant fruit and good balance would be appreciated :) Edit: Am really interested in varietal Syrah bottlings actually, any good producers? Looking at Mark Ryan wild eyes and L'ecole no 41 estate syrah right now, but I do not know the producers.

Dessert wine always a bonus :P (Edit: Riesling would be fine in a dessert wine, apologies for being unclear)

Thank you so much in advance and good luck with your thanksgiving plans <3

Wine Cooler/Fridge Advice Needed for Unconventional Reason!,1,1g62w3h,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1g62w3h/wine_coolerfridge_advice_needed_for/,2,2024-10-18 05:11:46,"Greetings fellow oenophiles!

Sadly, when I moved out of my last home nearly 2 years ago, we were unable to lug our ancient beast of a 300-400 bottle wine storage vault up the stairs of our 115 yr-old home and therefore had to include it as a ""feature"" of the sale (it worked btw!). We also had to drain my collection of fine wines prior to and after the sale since we didn't have a great place to store them in our ""new"" 110 yr-old home that we are now doing a full gut reno on. It was truly a VERY painful endeavor.  :)  My liver is still recovering, ha!

Anyway, here's an unusual question for you: I need a temperature and humidity-controlled space in which to store my dahlia tubers over the winter after I dig them out of the ground. A **single-zone** wine fridge/cooler with roughly a minimum of 36-48 bottle capacity (but bigger is always better), preferably less than $1000 US, and A STABLE TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY unit is what I need (temps in the 40s-50 F). I don't care if it's damn ugly, free-standing, etc., as it will be in my basement and have a temperature and humidity monitor in it. I cannot over-emphasize how important the stability of the temperature and humidity are. I have thousands of dollars invested in these tubers (not to mention all of the love and sweat equity that goes with gardening), so I cannot afford to lose them. 

As a trial, I bought one on Amazon during Prime Days last week for about $300 (by Antarctic) and have been monitoring the temps/humidity daily based on different temp settings ranging from 42-50 F. It has frankly been very disturbing. The photo shows the 3 monitors I had placed in it when I set the wine fridge at 43 F. (Note: I put the 2nd digital monitor and regular thermometer in 2 days later in order to ensure that the original digital monitor was accurate.) Bottom line: this unit is a piece of sh\*t due to the wild variations, and I didn't even mention the condensation on the inside. I will try to initiate a return to Amazon. Sigh...

Based on this, can you please provide me with your recommendations? I've been looking at TONS of reviews on-line in every place imaginable, but there doesn't appear to be a consensus. Again, I need a single-zone unit. Do you have any knowledge about the Cosmo 24"" 48-bottle unit (approx. $880 US)? It seems to get good reviews, but I'm doubtful of everything at this point. I'll take any and all recommendations, as I have to begin my harvest soon!

PS I don't want to buy a used unit on FB Marketplace, Craigslist, etc., as I don't want to take any further chances with reliability, etc.

Many thanks!"

Production Years > 1960s Champagne,42,1g4tabo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g4tabo,9,2024-10-16 13:52:02,"Hi guys.

So we are trying to decipher when a bottle of champagne we have might have been produced. So hoping there might be some people here who can help.

Backstory - itâ€™s part of a collection we manage and the story is the guy who the collection is about (Bruce McLaren) won/podium at a race in Reims. As a reward he got a case of champagne.

Naturally over the years these things disappear. Most likely was enjoyed at a house party or two! However one was donated to the collection saying it was a bottle Bruce won at Reims.

However photos of him on the podium show a different style label on the neck.

Champagne 
Heidsieck & Co
Dry Monopole

Interesting notes to help decipher
- has a royal warrant from the Queen
- contents is in pint/ounces

I have a photo of Bruce celebrating with a bottle same brand different neck label. Circa 1962.

Hopefully some wine detectives here :)"

I was just talking to a colleague about trade tastings, and we both agreed that we haven't been to a successful/well attended one since before the pandemic it feels like. They're just completely dead, I don't get any orders from attendees or measurable ROI. Not to mention super expensive to participate in.

The hotel I work at has a big selection of wines which are stored in house. I have been tasked with doing some research on small labels for each wine bottle. The labels have to fit on the bottom of the bottles as we plan to print a bar code and our product code on the label. The material also has to be sturdy in case the bottles need to be moved around in the storage room. We will need to label close to 22â€™000 bottles of wine.

What's the funniest or supidest experience you've have while drinking wine or opening a bottle?,24,1g4hddg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1g4hddg/whats_the_funniest_or_supidest_experience_youve/,12,2024-10-16 03:21:06,"List them! My personal faves:

1. My friend and her mom were visiting me, was their last night in Paris so we decided to open a bottle of wine and enjoy the view of the Eiffel tower. But we forgot a corkscrew, all the shops were closed, and for some reason nobody we asked had one. So we decided to come up with a plan, I would hold the bottle and jam a stick into the cork, and my friend would step on it. I did it before. Well, this time the bottle instantly exploded and lacerated my hand pretty badly, so the romantic sunset was cut short because we had to go wash my bloody and and arm off. Also because it was an air b' n b, there was nothing in the apartment so I just wrapped it in toilet paper.

2. Using 'the Breton method' to open a bottle of wine...once again, no bottle opener. So you take a shoe, put the bottle in it, and tap or bang it against a concrete wall. Worked like a charm and the night was saved! 

3. I was drinking some champagne with two or three friends in CafÃ© Oz. The bartenders started spraying champagne into the bar for a bit of entertainment, which is fun, but they accidentally sprayed my friend right in the face and her hair was soaked haha. She was not happy about that, but it was still funny. Then a few minutes later some crazy Australians threw like two beer bottles and they exploded on the wall right above us.

4. A friend's younger brother wanted to open a wine bottle, I said no, let me do it. He insisted. The cork flew up right in his face (literally flinging his hair on his forehead up) then bounced around everywhere. He dad also opened a bottle of wine/champagne with a sabre-like knife a few times, which was pretty cool."

- Estate tasting: flight of single-vineyard wines
- Century tour & library tasting: covers current releases & older vintage counterparts  
- â€œMonte Belloâ€ cab tasting: which seems to focus on wines specifically from the Monte Bello vineyard including current release M.B. 

For those of you who have been to the Lytton Springs location, Iâ€™d love to hear which tasting experiences youâ€™ve enjoyed?

I'm at the very beginning of my wine journey and want to focus on learning the ""basic/classic"" grapes, which I'd think would be pinot gris, sauvignon blanc, chardonnay, pinot noir, and cab sauv.

* **(1) Would you add anything else to ""basics/classics?"" these?** Gamay? Cab Franc? Merlot?

I want to get a strong sense of what is typical for these grapes. Thus,

* **(2) How many wines should I (reasonably) drink of each grape?**

>-> Obviously if I had unlimited time and budget, I would drink as many as possible, but I also don't think these grapes will be my favorites (right now I like things like Moscato d'Asti, Albarino, and orange wines, to be honest). So I am thinking 3-5? But I'm also mostly working on this alone, so I will probably waste lots of these bottles, especially if I'm trying to do them simultaneously? **(Is there any way to buy tiny wines, like the half bottles, or maybe you'd recommend I just go to a wine bar and drink glasses, so I'd pay the same prices but not waste?)**

* **(3) Of the number of wines I'm targetting for each grape, would you recommend focusing on just one region?**

>-> For instance, I could just drink French for all of these grapes; or for something like Pino Gris, which seems majority Italian, I could exclusively drink Italian? I think I'm trying to get a ""pure"" comparison

* **(4) Or is the idea more to drink one typical cheap one of the grape, one typical expensive wine of the grape, and a few weird category-stretching ones** (e.g., make sure to taste a ""typical"" stainless steel chardonnay in addition typical oak-aged ones)?
* **(5) How can I predict in advance whether a given wine will teach me about typicality? I would love specific recommendations for three typical chardonnays, for instance. Or is this the kind of thing to just ask at a wine shop, rather than on Reddit?**

**Or am I thinking about all of this all wrong?**

It's about $40 - $50 a bottle, so my question is is there anything similar to this closer to the maybe $25ish range? Would like to be able to have something with a similar profile more often without ""splurging"" on a bottle of this every time.

That said, I know itâ€™s a common opinion that in a tasting you should keep the wines fairly similar and stick to one consistent theme. Personally, I like tasting a bunch of different things and I think it helps you figure out what you really like, but I can also understand the argument that you will only really understand a wine in the context of other similar wines. Thereâ€™s also the fact that the order of the wines matters, I donâ€™t want the Riesling to make the Chardonnay seem flabby or the Rioja to be too intense after the Chardonnay. Weâ€™ll be having food between though, so Iâ€™m not too worried, but stillâ€¦ Thoughts?"

For the past two years, occasionally, maybe 10 times a year, weâ€™ll have a white wine at home, freshly bought from the fridge from a different bottle shop each time, and different brands and price ranges from cheap to expensive too.  Iâ€™ve found no correlation in the wine type, brand, cost or store where itâ€™s from. 

Weâ€™ve even stored wine in different fridges, but itâ€™s always a random wine. Weâ€™ll drink the first half of the bottle but the second half will generally taste like acid, make us gag, and generally there will be crystals in the bottom of the glass.

If you try to drink it, youâ€™ll vomit. If you add a mixer, it cannot mask the taste and youâ€™ll gag. 

Iâ€™ve asked a few people and Iâ€™ve been told tartrate crystals donâ€™t impact taste. The wine does not smell, and it is not kept outside of the fridge or open very long (max 3 days, sometimes shared in the same night and cannot be finished due to the issue). 

Whatâ€™s happening? Is there anything we can do to avoid it or is this supply chain issues?

The bulk of US wine acreage comes from the hot dry CA Central Valley - almost entirely planted with the wrong varieties,145,1g3mivd,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1g3mivd/the_bulk_of_us_wine_acreage_comes_from_the_hot/,73,2024-10-15 01:11:14,"The Central Valley grows 70% of California wine grapes, and California grows 80% of US grapes. This region alone counting for over half of US wine production (56%)! The area has a reputation for low quality wine, which doesn't seem too surprising given the mismatch between what's planted and what the climate is. The three varieties that come out as quality are Zinfandel, Petite Syrah, and Barbera - ALL warm southern varieties.

Looking at what's grown, it appears that some group of 'experts' made a bunch of horrible decisions decades ago to fill the region with a bunch of cool climate northern French varieties, because that was what consumers recognized. It's the same stuff as grown on the coast, except the coast is obviously going to do cool better.

Looking at Wine Folly's grape list [https://winefolly.com/grapes/](https://winefolly.com/grapes/), there's TONs of Spanish, Italian, Hungarian, Greek white and red varieties. Why the heck aren't these planted in the Central Valley? Where's the Xinomavro, Savatiano, Nero dâ€™Avola, Moschofilero? That's the type of stuff that should grow well.

People gripe about CA wine being either cheap crap or too expensive. I don't think the Coast is going to get cheaper, but I think there should be huge potential for the cheap crap to get good. The old world figured out what grew where and optimized. Seems like the US is still very much in trial and error phase. "

It was really incredible, way better than I expected. I opened at 12pm and tasted every hour or so until dinner at 6.30pm. It started with a very pretty nose of flowers and cherries but the palate was quite thin. Over time the nose evolved into a richer dusty red cherry and subtle cigar spice and the palate got richer and denser with more tannins and acidity and a very long and layered finish. By dinner it was just perfect. Dusty red cherries with a lovely hint of cedar and spice with mouthwatering acidity and really nice tannins. The finish was well over a minute and came in waves of different flavors. I drank it with carbonara, which is my favorite pairing for Sangiovese. If it is this good now I canâ€™t even imagine in 10-15 years."

When first opening, it was extremely dull and flat - definitely no tannins and not much fruit to speak of, either.  Almost seemed watered down.

An hour later it had developed a hint of an almost soy sauce type scent and the fruit started to show itself - it was strange, like it started to become more flavorful as it sat. 

At 2 hours, caramel and ripe fruits started to come through and the scent of soy subsided. It was excellent! I didnâ€™t write tasting notes down so I canâ€™t be more specific than those few that I remember but WOW what an experience! "

Wine Sales Rep- Is this normal?,35,1g3i7bu,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1g3i7bu/wine_sales_rep_is_this_normal/,45,2024-10-14 22:15:11,"Hi-

I am a wine sales rep in a metropolitan city. A very small company and this is my first job in the industry. Currently my pay structure is 99% commission (i basically dont get paid a base salary). I want to ask all of you in the wine industry; is this normal?

Again i work for a small company, unknown fine wines (theyre great wines tho), and i feel like i was taken advantage of while onboarding for this company. Its my first ""adult"" job if you will. Most of my pay *will* come from commission and i say that because i havent recieved any of my sales commission yet since it takes a while for that commission to come in. 

Since starting, I have opened new accounts, I dont get a current account list or any helpful resources for accounts. 

My commission isnt extravagantly high. I have a smaller portfolio and only really sell wine. I havent gotten to form a relationship yet to get good placements with on-premise accounts to do any by the glass programs, which is expected. 

I know for many other distribution/ supplier companies, sales reps or something of this nature with commission usually has a base pay. It may not be the most generous but they still include a **liveable** base pay. I dont have that. Im currently working a hospitality job weekends and nights to at least put food on the table and pay bills. Is that normal?

Would like any and all opinions. "

Not as easily available in Asia. At a grocery store in Georgetown found a decent selection. A better priced bottle and from France, perfect! It must taste good. Grab 2 Merlots from the same company it appeared. (Did a lot of shopping so only a brief look.)

Later when opened, we were disappointed it tasted mostly like fruit juice. My wife said like a cheap bottled sangria from the store. Sip more, look at bottles more....1 of them (pictured,) has a spelling error on the back. Alarmed, we start looking the bottles over, googling about fake alcohol which we have heard about. Of course find horror stories online but, doesn't seem like what we have.

Then, she screams out "" omg there's another label under it.."" Basically, there's a near transparent label below the label on the back that really only shows up with a light shining on it. Although the white labels clearly say they're from France, and mention the specific region....the wine is from Malaysia, and it's fruit juice and additives.

We really don't know what to say. Shocked, upset, glad we weren't poisoned by what it could have been we suppose. So now don't even know where to share this but want to because this is 1. Interesting and terrible 2.somehow want to let others know this can happen.

I'm feeling I need a bit of a change in my boozing, and have gotten my every-few-years itch for wine. I started looking into wines again and just figured I'd get a comment or two here if possible to address - 

* I am an IPA fan from early in my career. I know I don't have an interest in particularly sweet wines, but are there any types/genres/brands of wines you'd recommend from this as a starting point?
* How well does wine keep after opening? I can go through a six pack in a weekend or a week, and I don't know how well opened wine keeps. Is it best to finish a bottle within a night or two, or is it fine for 5+ days?
* My biggest pain point for getting into wine is that I find the taste to be predominantly ""alcohol"" in the same way I find a beer over 10-11%. Something like tequila I can often enjoy for just the taste despite it obviously being higher %. Is this just a case of acquiring a taste for wine? Or is it something like ""oh you've only had X wine, or only had cheap wine""? Because if anything I'd rather get a bottle of wine for cheaper than a 6 pack, or at least to have it last longer glass-to-can. 

Thank you whether or not I am given answers or am just told to shove off. "

Gorgeous space, great staff, was a super welcoming and family friendly environment. Doesn't seem to be quite as... discovered... by the Instagram croud like Pippin Hill and King are.

I grabbed this bottle of their Pinot noir, curious they're even growing it there at all, quite uncommon around there. Also I just love Pinot, what can I say? Didn't have terribly high expectations.

I was more than impressed. My immediate impression was ""old world,"" which really hit all the right notes for my own preference in Pinots. Gorgeous light ruby color, quite transparent. It has some bright cherry and herb notes on the nose, a little earthy. Palate is very nicely balanced, plenty of well integrated tannin, very bright acidity, fresh zippy red fruits and a good undercurrent of herbs and that wet leaves thing from a good Savigny Les Beaune. It needs the oak to lend a little bit of body, it's quite light. A touch linear, not going to confuse this with your good burgs or Willamette bottles, but I could easily blind call this a villages cote de beaune, Santenay, Fixin, etc along those lines. 13.5% ABV. 50% new oak for 11 months.

I really liked it, brought half a case home. Not cheap at $45 ish a bottle, but it's one of the best VA reds I've had. I'd give it maybe 90-91 points something like that. Check them out if you find yourself in CVille."

The whites were particularly fascinating in how they were identifiably cool climate, yet also had plenty of fruit notes that I would typically associate with a warmer climate wines.   

Among the reds, the shiraz was phenomenal. If you had given me this wine blind I would have certainly guessed CÃ´te-RÃ´tie.  

As per usual, all of the single-site pinot noirs were phenomenal. Among them the Tout PrÃ¨s was the best of a brilliant bunch.

Juicy on the palate as well, with red plum, nectarine, licorice.  Surprisingly youthful and fresh fruit forward wine for a 2004.  The clarity of the wine and very light tannins is quite different from most Australian Shiraz I've tried which has been much more concentrated and extracted.

I know I could always just pivot and take the CMS, but I honestly have no interest in the service aspect. I also recognize that at the end of the day itâ€™s a bit petty, but Iâ€™d still love your opinions. "

1. pour a bottle into a soft bottle, plastic pet or flask. do this the morning of travel and drink in evening.

2. use canned wine, never heard about it before actually. I live in the Netherlands.

3. strap the bladder of a boxed wine somewhere and bring this.(I feel like my options of choice of wine are limited by this when buying here in the Netherlands)

4.just strapping a bottle to the frame and opening when using it in the evening(less preferred due too chances of breaking, and added weight and inconvenience when packing)"

Sweet Red Wine?,1,1gp0av1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gp0av1/sweet_red_wine/,3,2024-11-12 02:09:50,As a beginner I'm looking for Red Wine specifically that has sweet taste. Any suggestions?
Thanks for helping me drink a 50 year cab,134,1go438u,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1go438u/thanks_for_helping_me_drink_a_50_year_cab/,14,2024-11-10 23:12:00,"I posted last year about buying a 50 year old wine.  After your suggestions, I found one from an online auction and bought it.  Living in the ""great"" state of Alabama, I had to have it shipped to a package store where they could charge me 29cents extra in taxes.   So weird.    You also suggested that a 50 year old cab would likely not be very good and to have a backup bottle, so I went to the store and without realizing it, bought another cab from the same vineyard.  So we had a bottle from 1974 and 2020.  Fortunately, the 74 was actually pretty good.  The color had faded a bit, and it had lost ""something"", but otherwise was enjoyable.  I would equate it to listening to a song and turning the bass all the way down.  You know what you are listening to and you might even start hearing a couple things you wouldn't have noticed normally, but there is definitely something missing.  Anyway, thanks for the help, it went very well!

Schramsberg Vineyards, Chappellet

**Day 2:**
Quintessa, Stagâ€™s Leap Wine Cellars, dinner at Auberge du Soleil 

**Day 3:**
Chateau Montelena, O'Shaughnessy Estate Winery (personal connection)

Thanks to everyone who commented and DMâ€™d me.

We have moved things around a little and decided to drop SLWC and instead go to CADE Estate Winery and Opus One along with Quintessa on Day 2. We also canceled our reservation at Auberge du Soleil and made a reservation at PRESS.

What are the best wine guides for each region?,9,1goh3f7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1goh3f7/what_are_the_best_wine_guides_for_each_region/,3,2024-11-11 08:55:12,"I was wondering this at work yesterday. 

Iâ€™m a somm in Australia, usually if I have to make a selection for wines to consider and I havenâ€™t tried one Iâ€™ll default to Halliday to give me a rough idea of what to expect quality wise. Usually pretty reliable and really a great reference book as well.

When I look internationally, Iâ€™ve been using Suckling as my go to for looking at wines that I havenâ€™t had before and to be honest, I just donâ€™t agree with the ratings as much, lots of very average but highly rated wines, I feel like I just canâ€™t use it reliably as a resource for my job anymore. Also, not as comprehensive as Iâ€™d like as well.

What do you guys think are great resources for wines within each region? Like a great Spain or Italy guide, maybe even region specific like burgundy or Bordeaux. Specifically USA? Or South America?

Iâ€™d rather have 10 great guides then one just okay guide"

The cooked wine experiment ,10,1goekwq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1goekwq,4,2024-11-11 06:48:59,"Ever wonder what would happen if you left wine in a 110 degree room for 11 days? Well, let me tell you because this is exactly what happened to our friendsâ€™ wine. 

Their house had to go through water remediation and part of the process was to blast their basement with hot air machines, which unfortunately cooked all their wine. While the wine wasnâ€™t anything high end or fancy, there were certainly a couple of bottles which I was familiar with that I was definitely sad to hear were ruined. 

Nothing turned into vinegar or tasted like stewed fruits surprisingly. The main theme was that pretty much all of them tasted flat and smelled like nothing. They werenâ€™t disgusting, just veryâ€¦blah. Meh. Pretty much flavorless. 

The only exception was the 19 Crimes. It was terrible, but that probably wasnâ€™t due to the heat. The heat did seem to kill the nose, but I picked up some weird root beer, sarsaparilla, cream soda, cola note, definitely like fake sugary kind of note. 

On the palate, it was some kind of caramel and Dr Pepper with a hint of cherry robitussin. I almost spit it out because it was so nasty. 

It was honestly kind of exciting how bad it was, considering everything else was so flat. If youâ€™ve heard of movies that are so bad theyâ€™re good, this was almost like that, but with wine, and it wasnâ€™t actually good. But it was fun making fun of the 19 Crimes wine and very educational to taste the other wines that had been damaged by heat.

Oh - the Prosecco honestly wasnâ€™t too bad either, but La Marca isnâ€™t great to begin with, so the bar was pretty low, but it still had good fizz and didnâ€™t taste all that noticeably worse than a normal bottle! "

Spiced cherry, crushed rose petals, a touch earthy. 

Paired well with dinner which was farmstand pork chops with crispy shallots and garlic butter served with roast acorn and delicata squash and Brussels sprouts with sage brown butter and crushed roasted hazelnuts. A little homemade cranberry sauce on the side, too. Probably a Chardonnay would have paired beautifully but I saw Collotte Marsannay in the shop and had to. "

This wine is at its peak, I think, but can also probably last for the new few decades.

At first I was little disappointed because it was so closed down on the palate. But after two hours in the decanter it started singing. Really interesting raspberry turnover notes on the nose, followed by ripe red fruits and a subtle mineral spine. Garrigue and huge red fruit on the palate. The flavor just goes on and on. Balanced by graceful acidity. Bold while also Elegant. What every Grenache-based wine hopes it will be when it grows up. Really some of the best CDP I have ever had. Glad to have two more bottles. "

Trip to Napa & Getting Into â€œExpensiveâ€ Wine,44,1gne1pv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gne1pv,55,2024-11-09 23:38:36,"My wife and I recently celebrated our 10th anniversary by taking a trip to Napa and Sonoma to experience the Californian wine scene. We had the privilege of visiting a couple small/new wineries as well as some of the established greats, like Charles Krug and Rodney Strong (both were amazing). We did get to try some relatively expensive for us ($80-$120+ per bottle) wines, which is outside our typical $20-30 bottle table wine budget. However, the quality of these higher end wines was very apparent.  It got us thinking about increasing our budget to occasionally treat ourselves to one â€œexpensiveâ€ bottle every so often. But for that price, we want to be pretty confident weâ€™re going to enjoy it. Any advice on the best way to evaluate the value/quality of wine in this price range before making the purchase? Outside of that, I just wanted to share how much we enjoyed our trip to this wonderful part of the wine world. Cheers!"

I have a lot of hobbies that that lend themselves to that lifestyle lol. I donâ€™t usually find wine, but this was too crazy of a find to pass up.  I spent $20 all in. Iâ€™m erring on the side of all of them being dead.  Certainly going to open these up over time, and I will definitely report back. Left to right..

Petrus 1970.  Mid low shoulder fill.  Insanely depressed cork. I want so bad for this to be a miracleâ€¦

Haut Brion 1974 - Iâ€™d bet everything that this is toast. Never seen such low ullage. Iâ€™m still gonna open it up and smell it. Who knows? The bottle is a really interesting shape. 

Weingut Dr. Alex Senfter - nierfteiner Orbel Riesling Beerenauslese 1976 - this one has a nice looking level, but brown glass makes it hard to tell whatâ€™s inside.  Kinda have some hope for this one..

Beaulieu Vineyard private reserve 1971 - if only the petrus had the fill level of this one.  Decent cork and capsule position. Cellar tracker notes are not inspiring, but Iâ€™d be glad to open this up for science.

Porto Barros 1890 - I started shaking when I picked this one up haha. Not too familiar with ports this old.  The wax on the capsule is super crusty looking. The fill level is right to the top of the shoulder.  I have pretty high hopes for this one.

Offley Vintage Port 1963 - upper mid shoulder fill. Cork seems a little depressed. 

Out of all of these, I really want the Petrus and 1890 port to shock me. "

I'm a burgundy noob, so take my notes with a grain of salt.

Chateau De La Tour

Nose: Very balanced between red fruit, earth, tiny amount of spice, and a dusty note.

Palate: Very complex. Notes of spce, like black pepper, leather, tobacco, hints of red fruit. Very balanced. Also one unique note I can't describe, but it wasn't something I'm used to. Very high concentration of flavor, medium-high body

Finish: medium tannins, strong leather, dark chocolate, spice in the initial finish

Nicolas Rossignoe

Nose: More earthy on the nose, not much fruit, spice

Palate: Similar to the nose, earthy, leather, black pepper. Less concentration than the previous, slightly watery, but still very good.

Finish: Low tannins, but still present, slight amoumt of dark chocolate bitterness, good length

Two very good wines overall. I preferred the De La Tour, but these are basically my first two burgundies ever. Normally, we drink bordeaux, barolo, chianti, or Rioja and occasionally some new world wines, but not much Pinot in general. I did some research and found these wines over the past month and now I think I might have gotten some of my co-workers addicted to burgundy lol."

No fruit, lots of spice, tobacco, forest floor. Moderate tannins and a medium finish. I think in a few years when the fruit may come out it will be more balanced. 
No regrets opening a young bottle, was worth it to remember the trip. "

Wasnt familiar with the producer, but plenty of available info!Grapes harvested on September 7, 2019 - then 15 months ageing on fine lees. Stored at 55, popped and poured - no decanting. Paired with a grilled salmon and some rice.

Visually, a strong ruby color, hints of purple at the edge. Beautiful color.

On the nose, I went in expecting the usual red fruits of a gamay - was incredibly surprised to pick up herbs and spices reminiscent of the Southern Rhone! Less flowers than I expected. Deeper into the glass, blueberries - with a hint of the usual strawberries and cherries I expected. Fantastic scents for a gamay, I'm sure partly thanks to the terroir of this Cru.

On the palate - medium bodied, yet still refreshing to drink. A pleasant tannin grip, perhaps I should've aired it out a little - yet balanced, with a good bit of acidity. No notable burn at all (label shows it as 11-14% ABV? Wild LOL. Never seen an abv >range< before.) Dry. Flavors of blackberry pie, blueberry jam - bit of pepper at the tail end. The herbs continue - a fantastic bit of complexity at the price point. Nice long finish. This was $25?

My first Cote-de-Brouilly, and I'm absolutely blown away here. The nose, the palate - fantastic value here. Delicious in every way, and I cant wait to track down other producers. Highly recommended!!"

Great communication, and we ended up spending nearly three hours there. Seeing their horses, cellar, production facility, historic home, and vines was one of the highlights of our trip. The clarets and field blends were great and extremely interesting blends. The work theyâ€™ve done on their property and vines is evident in the product and the passion for what theyâ€™re doing.

Not a single score, definitely not a list of aromas and flavors, but relatively easily measurable characteristics that would correlate with the ""quality"", i.e, serve as a buying guideline for an intelligent but not-very-well-versed-in-wine-yet human.

Say, my wife sees Chateau TrouvÃ© for 20$, Chateau Perdu for 200$, and Chateau Ã‰garÃ© for 35$ in a shop. She checks the notes and they are like ""... minty-edge to the cedar, tobacco, cigar box..."", ""... dried roses, mint, tobacco, dried cherries..."", ""... mint, smoke, cherries and raspberries..."" â€” absolutely unhelpful for her to make a choice (she grabs the one with the nicest label or the one with more medals). What I think would help her, or some redditors here, to make an informed decision, is to mention that, say, the bottle of Ã‰garÃ© for 35 bucks is better balanced and is a bit more complex than TrouvÃ© for 20$.

Not sure asking AI helps (yet?). For example, Gemini seems to care more about classification, reputation, and critic reviews, not to mention it often gets basic facts wrong.

With that, here are a few of my criteria to seed the discussion:

* Balance, both in main compounds (acid, alcohol, sugar, polyphenols) and in taste perception

* Duration of the aftertaste

* Complexity of the story the wine tells, e.g., ""light and fruity nose but surprisingly deep note of cherry that evolves into whatnot and becomes thisthat...""

What are yours?"

Rhone Valley,0,1gn3le3,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gn3le3/rhone_valley/,5,2024-11-09 13:02:10,Im planning our first wine tasting trip in the Rhone Valley.

"2020 Domaine de Leyre-Loup Fleurie | Too much Cru Beaujolais, not enough time!",7,1gmqth4,https://i.redd.it/greitv5fbqzd1.jpeg,1,2024-11-09 02:27:42,"Purchased a bottle to go along with dinner at a local wine bar, No Reservations, in Miami - was in the mood for some Cru Beaujolais when I walked in, so happy to see it on the menu! Paired with grilled lamb chops. Served a little cold (felt like 35-40), but warmed up as the night went on - not decanted.

Visually, a strong purple color - once I put my flash to it!

On the nose, bountiful floral scents at the rim - a bouquet of lovely fresh flowers on a spring day. Deeper into the glass, strong notes of ripe strawberries and cherries. Took a bit to open up - but I pin that more on the serving temperature than anything.

On the palate, fantastically crisp and refreshing, especially chilled. Lightly bodied, pleasant acidity, barely any notable tannin grip - par for the course with the grape. Dry, with perceived sweetness due to the strong ripe red fruit flavor more so than any actual sugar. That same nose of cherries and strawberries resumed on the palate, bountiful red fruit. Delicious, albeit no real complexity of flavor to me. Decent finish, and a great pairing with the lightly seasoned lamb and vegetable salad.

The bottle went for $58, but the host reduced it to $29 for me, and for a restaurant bottle at that point, I was definitely very satisfied with the value (since $58 gets me some good Big 4 Morgon). Took half the bottle home where it promptly didn't survive the night. Will happily continue pursuing Fleurie and the other Crus (eyeing a particular Cote de Brouilly for tonight)! Looking up the producer online, I was happy to see them using very sustainable and organic farming methods, which will have me choose them again soon. Recommended! 

(Oh, and for any locals, the wine bar I mention above is fantastic)"

So far I've explored a bunch of red wines and figured out what I **don't like:**

1. Heavy, full, overly sweet reds (e.g. a lot of California reds like Zinfandel/Cabs)

2. Musty, chocolate, spicy, earthy tones

  
What I **do like:**

1. Lighter wines (leaning dry, but some amount of sweetness is nice)

2. Love love the chillable red wines

3. Floral/fruity scent/taste but not toooo sweet

4. Generally, I've found that the wines I like have a translucent/transparent reddish color? (like a french pinot/gamay?)

just had a lovely meal in Paris with a bottle of wine that was pleasant to start, but unfortunately became noticeably mousey within 45 minutes. I'm more than open to natural wines, and have served and sold many, but typically I'm more used to wines that turn around the second day mark and was unpleasantly surprised that this was so noticeably faulty before the mains even hit the table.

This got me thinking about the changes in the dynamics of wine consumption and how the industry reacts to it. The whole process of tasting a wine prior to serving is focused on cork taint... So while working as a Somm, I would accept a return from a guest where the cork taint became prominent over time (ie not noticed immediately upon serving to the guest), I don't know how I would feel about a wine that became mousey over the course of a meal... Conversely, as a guest, I didn't feel comfortable returning a wine that had become mousey (even though it happened so fast).

I feel like I'm rambling a bit, but I'm curious - if you're eating in a restaurant, under what circumstances would you return a bottle of wine that had gone mousey? Do you think mousiness is given more of a ""free pass"" than other taints? And if so, do you think thats fair?

Hopefully I'm not opening a can of worms here but I'm interested. Both as someone who is neither staunchly pro or anti natural wine, but also as a consumer who is usually on the other side of the interaction.

Appreciate your insights. Cheers."

Quintessa: known for its long history of organic/biodynamic winemaking practices. 91% Cab Sauv and 60% new French oak. Dark berry fruit and granular, smooth tannins. Great acidity. 

Ornellaia: Bolgheri blend of 62% Cab Sauv, 31% Merlot, and a dappling of Petite Verdot and Cab Franc. Chalky tannins, earthy, tomato vine, and a jab of VA that improved with time in the glass. This one needs the most time to show itself out of all the wines tasted today. 

Chateau Mouton-Rothschild: lots of green bell pepper up front that integrated better with time in the glass. Angular, muscular, lots of personality.

I've got one more stored away and I think I'll plan to keep it until about 2030 based off tasting this one. 

This like most post 1990 disznoko is a spectacular example of what tokaji can be. I opened this bottle for about 15min and then decided to decant and start to taste after another 15-20min in the decanter. We ended up drinking it over the next hour. 

Upon starting to drink this it was extremely bright, lemon curd, dried apricot, fresh ginger, white peaches, and the trademark botytris funk. Still quite fresh and lively. Weighty and sweet but had substantial acid to back it up. Over time it got a bit more subdued on acidity and came really into balance and opened up to where I feel it was ideal after around an hour or so open. Towards the end of the bottle it did begin to lean a little bitter and flabby as it had started falling off. Still plenty of life left but definitely thinking it will be in its prime with only a quick decant off sediment before drinking with good company in 5-6 years. "
2009 Drouhin Oregon Chardonnay REVIEW,43,1gkosej,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gkosej,4,2024-11-06 10:05:03,"Updating from an earlier post, with my first review here on r/wine! 

Iâ€™ve slowly gotten into the wine world over the last few years, and working in the fine dining industry, Iâ€™m lucky to be exposed to a lot of higher level bottles and people who are amazing and willing to share. My first epiphany moment with wine, the sip that turned on the light bulb, was a 2010 Roulot white burgundy. I was so intrigued and so thrown off by the amount of flavors and textures and feelings that the wine thrust upon me, I didnâ€™t know how to react. Following this experience, I was sent into a two year foray into white burgundy and have found myself with significantly lighter pockets since. As an avid drinker of Nebbiolo and lover of Italy, I had sworn France to be overrated and dull. Boy, did this day prove me wrong! 

Ive been chasing that dragon since, and landed on Meursault and Pouilly-Fuisse, or more southern burg whites as my palettes choice due to the richness, creaminess, and more oak, as opposed to higher acid and steely-clean, crisp Chablis counterparts. 

Today, we have a bottle that intrigued me when I saw it, excited me when I got home and did some research, and blew my mind when I opened it. 

2009 Drouhin â€œArthurâ€ Oregon Chardonnay, found this among 4-5 more, covered in dust in a south Florida liquor store. Hereâ€™s my novice review so we can all get this over withâ€¦

Med-deep gold color, almost amber, gold flake and perfectly hued. Intense nose, flooded with deep, rich, and creamy apple orchard notes, little bit of flint, lot of brown butter and seriously (SERIOUSLY) heavy popcorn, but it was so good, no chemical traces, just organic pure old butter. Insanity. Wine was dry, weighty, but so well integrated, little bit of tannin (from oak maybe?) but it was so dang smooth. Medium acid, high alcohol, full body, intense flavor, crazy long finish. This wine is outstanding and was preserved so well! 
Iâ€™m going to buy the rest tomorrow. Overall 9/10 and blew my expectations out of the water. So balanced, so tertiary. Rich and smooth oak, toasted sourdough, kombucha and apples, buuuttterr, brown butter, more butterâ€¦. Lots of vanilla and little nutmeg, soft cheeseâ€¦ marmaladeâ€¦ man it just keeps going. Thanks for reading and if you see one of these, I canâ€™t recommend it enough. The age has done this wine such a service and Iâ€™d say this is its prime. "

"Wine buying for beginners, how do I decide what is good and bad?",1,1gkvlpn,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gkvlpn/wine_buying_for_beginners_how_do_i_decide_what_is/,18,2024-11-06 17:38:47,"I like good wine, to no oneâ€™s surprise. But Iâ€™m having a hard time pricing out which region, grape, method or whatever to buy for what I need it for. I have a few go to vineyards that I know are good and cheap, but Iâ€™d like to expand on that. 

So, imagine youâ€™re in a supermarket (thatâ€™s where I usually go if I donâ€™t want to spend a fortune), you donâ€™t know any of the wines, and your Vivino app isnâ€™t working.  You know what occasion you need it for (meal, pre dinner, sparkly and whatever). How do you pick out a bottle?

Are there any information on the bottle, country, the price, the grape or anything that helps you decide? Iâ€™d imagine going for offers lets your money stretch to a better wine, but more expensive doesnâ€™t always equal better in my limited experience. 

Let me know your thought process"

It's been an overseas export from day #1 due to the fortification.   
All the terminology of styles is in English language rather then Portuguese (except for ""Colheita"").   
Its perceived as having a sort of an aristocratic personality.   
In reality none of those perceptions is wrong. But instead of attracting people, it scares them away.

I have the feeling that most people has not had a first good experience with Port. There's a lot of basic/cheap Port flooding the shelves and very little top tier cuveÃ©s or older blends...

  
I would love to know your opinion. How do you look at Port? Have you had a good/very good experience?

Have you ever thought of visiting the Douro region to get into Port. Or that's something now worthwhile for you?

As I understand, this improvement comes due to a bigger/deeper root structure and in general only after 15-20 years will vines start to approach their potential in terms of quality production.
My question is, if there are no constraints on the grower, can this be attained sooner? For instance, no irrigation and aggressive pruning to next to no yield, would this result in better quality wine, sooner?"

Black cherry and more earthly notes. Maybe even leather? Missing some nuance on the front end and really hitting heavily in the mid-mouth.

Outstanding persistence, good varietal character, just crunchy enough to let you know thereâ€™s cab franc and have it be a feature, still had a really lush red plum character without feeling overblown, great tension. I was over worried that it would be tired and popped and poured. Kept growing for hours. The cheval des andes was the star. Iâ€™ve had younger Malbecs that donâ€™t have the muscles this had. Didnâ€™t drink like a young wine obviously. Really a master class in balance. Blackberry, tobacco, sanguine, light bell pepper in the South American style. Enough acidity to stand up to any food. 

The 2016 lâ€™enclos was insurance and not opened.


For food, I made beech mushroom toasts with magic dust seasoning from the hitching post and a red wine reduction. Those were aimed at the Pinots and paired well.

For the Bordeaux blends it was cheeseburgers with onion rings. Gave them smoke to 115 and then finished on a skillet. Seasoned with oregano, mushroom powder, sumac, basil, and nutmeg. Onion rings got hop cat crack fries seasoning. A little sweet. "

Visiting Jerez - Field Report & Recommendations,19,1gjonqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gjonqf/visiting_jerez_field_report_recommendations/,13,2024-11-05 03:41:28,"With Sherry Week kicking off today, I wanted to share my experience and recommendations from a trip to the incredible region of Jerez in early October.

**Background**: Iâ€™m based in Poland and got interested in Sherry two years ago through WSET 2. Earlier this year, I completed an intermediate course by Consejo Regulador Vinos de Jerez. I donâ€™t speak Spanish.

**Getting There**: Reaching Jerez is surprisingly easy. While thereâ€™s a small airport, taking the train is likely the simplest route, either from Madrid (\~4 hours) or Seville (\~1 hour).

**Getting Around**: The key bodegas (wineries) are in Jerez, SanlÃºcar de Barrameda, and El Puerto de Santa MarÃ­a. A convenient bus from Jerez (near the train station) goes to SanlÃºcar, and thereâ€™s a quick train to El Puerto. Iâ€™d advise against renting a carâ€”Sherry is fortified, and one tasting alone can be potent! Public transport is reliable, so thereâ€™s no need to drive.

**Arrival in Jerez**: We arrived in Jerez on a Sunday and stayed at a comfortable, reasonably priced accommodation booked through Booking. October wasnâ€™t crowded with tourists, and the weather was fantastic. The city is compact, very walkable, and filled with beautiful architecture. I wish I had more time to explore, but of course, the main goal was to drink Sherry!

The city is full of bars, particularly â€œtabancosâ€ (Sherry bars), where a glass ranges from 1â‚¬ to 5â‚¬. The quality is usually great, though there are occasional misses.

**Dining at La CarbonÃ¡**: On our first night, we had a reservation at La CarbonÃ¡ (https://maps.app.goo.gl/mJ411xqBpQS7KJ9X7), recommended by this subreddit. We chose the â€œLola CarbonÃ¡â€ tasting menu, which was 75â‚¬ per person and included 7 dishes paired with 7 different Sherries. Though there were some minor slip-ups (a shell in the seafood and limited English), the experience was a fantastic start to our trip.

**Exploring SanlÃºcar de Barrameda**: Early the next day, we took the bus to SanlÃºcar, a smaller seaside town with plenty of charm. Our first stop was Bodegas Hidalgo la Gitana (https://bodegashidalgolagitana.com/), which was incredible! The cathedral-like bodega building was awe-inspiring, and the tour was both informative and fun. For 19,50â‚¬, we tasted four Sherries, including two drawn directly from barrels with a traditional *venencia*. You even get to keep a branded glass as a memento. We left with a bottle of their Manzanilla Pastrana.

Afterward, we wandered to Bodegas ArgÃ¼eso (https://maps.app.goo.gl/YGtMGLEBheHYvbbP8) for a quick, free tasting in their shop. It was a good experience, though language was a bit of a barrier.

Our walk to Bodega Delgado Zuleta (https://maps.app.goo.gl/GXaJk9PvhGrDHRr29) led us to a pleasant surprise at Bodegas BarÃ³n (https://maps.app.goo.gl/zrCPuwmoGh5c84Vj9). Despite the language gap, the friendly staff gave us an impromptu tasting directly from the barrels. We ended up buying a bottle of their Manzanilla Pasada.

At Delgado Zuleta, we didnâ€™t have a reservation, but a kind staff member offered us a small free tasting. We sampled five or six different Sherries and bought a bottle of their Amontillado.

After a day full of tasting, we enjoyed a meal at Taberna der Guerrita (https://maps.app.goo.gl/qdwEh9vkcw4D6nuC6), another spot recommended here. The tapas were incredible, andâ€”perhaps inspired by all the Sherryâ€”we accidentally ordered bullâ€™s testicles! Also, be sure to check out their *trastienda*, a shop filled with Sherries.

**Sherry Museum at Bodegas Barbadillo**: We wrapped up SanlÃºcar with a stop at a small museum in Bodegas Barbadillo, which is worth a visit. Naturally, there was another tasting in the shop before we headed back to Jerez with five bottles in my backpack.

**Flamenco Night in Jerez**: That evening, we went to Tabanco El Pasaje (https://maps.app.goo.gl/WdU6Vhakca2TxiA4A) for a flamenco show. Although itâ€™s a popular tourist spot, the ambiance was great. We ordered a premium tapas set and enjoyed a house Amontillado that was so good we ordered another. The show itself was intense at first but very captivating.

**Touring the Iconic Bodegas**: The next morning, we visited Bodegas Lustau (https://lustau.es/en/) for a 30â‚¬ tour that included 7 Sherries (one VORS) and a vermouth. It was an amazing experience, and we bought a VORS bottle.

Later, we went to the renowned Bodega Tio Pepe (https://www.tiopepe.com/es-es/reserva). While the 24,90â‚¬ tour (4 Sherries included) was enjoyable, it felt a bit commercial with amusements like ""Sherry train ride.""

**Bodegas TradiciÃ³n**: Our final day began at Bodegas TradiciÃ³n (https://bodegastradicion.es/), which was absolutely outstanding. We received a private tour (as we were the only guests that day) with Ãgueda, who adapted her guidance to our deeper knowledge of Sherry. Afterward, we explored the ownerâ€™s private art collection, featuring Spanish masterpieces by artists like El Greco, VelÃ¡zquez or Goya. The tasting included two VOS, three VORS, and one Fino, all truly exceptional. This premium experience costs 55â‚¬ per person but is absolutely worth it.

**Final Stops**: Our last stop was Bodegas Fundador (https://brandyfundador.com/visita-bodega/), a large-scale bodega with a 30â‚¬ tour featuring three VORS. Afterward, we visited Vinos y Licores La Estrella (https://maps.app.goo.gl/aSXtcEMo37nSkkkr7) for a few final bottles before attempting a visit to the Consejo Regulador (https://maps.app.goo.gl/T7bcD9ZfdCJCZUh58), which, unfortunately, was closed during declared opening hours.

**Final Thoughts**: My trip to Jerez was unforgettable, and Iâ€™ll definitely be backâ€”maybe even next year. The region and its wines seem vastly underrated, which keeps prices affordable. And I still need to explore El Puerto!

**Bonus Tips**: If youâ€™re nearby, consider visiting Cadiz (a short train ride) and Seville. In Cadiz, GorriÃ³n (https://maps.app.goo.gl/NKt4MntEayq4EUfV7) is a great wine bar, while Baco Vinos (https://maps.app.goo.gl/mVEAHMfmXMtF8b3A8) is a well-stocked shop with English-speaking staff. Taberna La Manzanilla (https://maps.app.goo.gl/K9g5NUCgbu8VtzGj9) serves exclusively Sherries, many aged to VOS or VORS but declassified. In Seville, Vinoteca Lama La Uva (https://maps.app.goo.gl/55yxN3KHdSAu3o137) has an excellent selection and very kind, English-speaking owner, and Bar Casa Morales (https://maps.app.goo.gl/uxGHgZuVVxHSjUhQA) offers affordable, authentic, delicious experiences (the secret to get inside is to try all three different entrances).

Cheers, folks! Enjoy your Sherryâ€”not only this week!

I donâ€™t have any experience with Gavi di Gavi, this was really lovely. I got hits of nectarine and pear on the nose, and something a little savoury, like almond meal? Medium bodied, with more white stone fruit and spice, this was perfect with dinner.

Balade oenologique tasting package,12,1gjndkh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gjndkh,2,2024-11-05 02:49:17,"This is a tasting package of samples of BIO French wines. It's a blind tasting, you can read what you drank afterwards and they also provide tasting notes in French(see last images). I wrote my tasting notes before reading theirs, seems like for some of them we agreed for others not so much :) . First wine is no. 2, I forgot to take a picture of wine 1, it looked pretty similar to no 2 if a bit lighter maybe.

Wine 1
Sweet, apricot smell on the nose, as well as a bit of yeasty character and floral notes.
On the palate, quite acidic, and somewhat fruity, citrus with a bit of pear and apricot. Yeasty character persists on the palate.
Finish is more yeasty than anything else, lingering for a bit.

Wine 2
On the nose, pretty fruity, I think peach, yeasty notes here as well. The fruit persists on the palate, with a bit of a subtle thyme and oregano note going on as well, with the yeasty character here too. It also reminds me a bit of maybe a very fresh fruit tart? I don't know how to put it better. Quite savory, the finish is somewhat short. An interesting wine

Wine 3
A rose wine. On the nose, I'm honestly not getting much except for a slight floral note. On the palate, it's fruity, maybe some sort of red forest fruit, but again somewhat faint. The finish is surprisingly long and powerful, much more clear redcurrant than when you just taste it first. 

Wine 4
The first red wine. This is a light red wine, with musky and floral notes on the nose. Quite acidic, with light tannins. Body is thin. Definitely looks like Pinot Noir. I'm getting notes of cherry, plum and some almost tomato like savory note. In enjoyed this wine.

Wine 5

A much more corpolent red wine. On the nose, forest floor and redcurrant. Moderate acidity and tannins. Quite pleasant, easy-drinking but still somewhat powerful. I'm getting redcurrant and just berries in general. A bit of dried plum as well, especially on the finish. Finish is quite prolonged. 

Wine 6

A dark red wine. Pretty strong eucalyptus on the nose. Besides that, I'm also getting an almost cherry cola like note on the nose. Moderate acidity and somewhat strong tannins. The eucalyptus persists on the palate, being however complemented by cherry as well as dark fruit notes, such as blackcurrant and I think blackberry. Quite savory, long finish. Quite a complex wine, I really enjoyed this one.

"Have you ever advised, inserted yourself, or helped out an aging person with their wine collection?",6,1gjp4q4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gjp4q4/have_you_ever_advised_inserted_yourself_or_helped/,10,2024-11-05 04:00:37,"TL;DR - have you advised or helped out any aging wine collector population on the need to ""move"" wines, drink them, or get rid of stuff before it ages out? Even my healthy and hip Dad at 80 has a collection that isn't moving as fast, and I suspect we're seeing stuff die, and I feel like I should involve myself a bit.

\---------

I've worked my whole career in food and beverage in kitchens and front of house, then rooms ops and hospitality, eventually leading to design/build stuff, all since 1995. I've seen builds and helped with some wine rooms, in ideal and not so ideal situations. Then you move on... and old school inventory control still meant directors would ignore / miss some wine, or not sell it so it ages out and is no longer good. That's a bummer. It wasn't under my management, but I've seen some pretty stellar wine inventories get into disarray. It breaks your heart to see stuff turn or get ignored.

That being said, I notice baby boomers are both not traveling, nor eating or drinking, like they used to. Their cellars are full, and it's part of the ding the industry is having in re-inventing, modernizing, reaching new audiences, and competing with this temperance movement, weed, and interest in seltzers (the new Zima, Bartles and James, Smirnoff Ice, and this too shall pass). But they can't rely on boomers to buy, with as full as some of those cellars are!

But I do think there are a lot of personal collections that are turning. I mean, I'm 48 and I'm shocked what the pandemic did to my brain and time... I keep thinking a bunch of my collection is just 3 to 5 years old, and all of a sudden it's 15 years old, etc. So I realize there's a bunch of baby boomer collections that aren't being drunk as rapidly, and there are absolutely a bunch of cellars all over the world that just has turning or dead wines, and I want to know if any of you have done anything to prevent that?

I don't mean pilfering or self-interest, but have any of you helped a parent or friend by auditing a collection and sort of organizing what should be drunk or at least considered before it expires? How'd it go? 

I think this question might be extremely silly, so I might delete. Just curious if people have started seeing wine collections get ignored, sort of abandoned, and good stuff turning over time. Cheers all.

This wine had a garnet color with a vivid ruby rim. I picked up notes of black cherries, peppercorn, and cedar with a hint of flint. With a medium body and a delightfully long finish, I found this wine to be thoroughly enjoyable.

My go-to reliable whites for casual drinking. I can never say no to a bottle when I'm out searching for more bottles, and at a comfortably priced $15 at my local wine shop, an easy purchase to try out a new producer. Stored at 45, popped and poured - to note, it's a screwcap! Sipped sans pairing on the first night, paired with grilled chicken and potatoes on day two.

On the nose, faint floral scents at the rim - honeysuckle and citrus blossom. Further in, familiar notes of grapefruit, lemon - surprisingly no stone fruit, as I would've expected - faint apple. The first night it smelled like an entry level Bordeaux Sauv Blanc (some melon waved hello) - but on day two, the scent was much more what I'm used to from the region. Strong citrus. 

On the palate, quite light - medium dry, so there is a tasty bit of sweetness. Not as much acidity as I would've hoped, a little restrained in that regard for my tastes. Also, at 12.5%, zero noticeable burn to speak of. In composition, a super easy drinker! Flavors of apples, lemon, lime - none of the nutty flavors I've grown to love in higher end examples of the appellation - very citrus dominant, like the nose. It's still in the mid 80s here in Florida, so a great white wine to enjoy chilled outside.

At the price point, I still favor Maison Darragon or Famille Bougrier, but it's still a good example of entry level Vouvray - refreshing and tasty. Recommended! "

Another producer from that region Filipa Pato, also recommanded.

Proud of their region, local grapes. 10 euro a glass at the bar, i guess 20-25 euro a bottle local price. 

So much flavour and freshness at the same time, low alcohol due to the atlantic ocean. 

WOW, also the same in Germany, France and Italy. Be authentic and dont mess around too much, wine without makeup is the slogan from Filipa Pato.

I was only in Portugal for 4 days, but it will get a more prominent place in my wine cellar."

I also don't think I've ever watched a movie with two main characters who were so unlikeable with 2 hours of just lying to everyone about everything. Maybe because I didn't see it new, that I missed the cultural zeitgeist that this movie did to Pinot and SBC wine country?

Kirkland 2023 Russian River Valley Pinot Noir,2,1gj5mdu,https://i.redd.it/6wney2a95tyd1.jpeg,6,2024-11-04 10:54:25,"Being relatively new to Costco, the idea of a serviceable weekday pinot noir (from the RRV AVA no less) for only $12 seemed intriguing.

Itâ€™s not as good as I hoped it would be, however, it managed to beat out the Belle Glos I reviewed a few days ago. Anywayâ€¦.

A little sweet for a pinot, and slightly heavier in mouthfeel than average, but for $12 itâ€™s not unbearably so. Itâ€™s just enough to remind you that youâ€™re drinking a mass produced pinot where some corners have been cut, and some liberties taken.

This is all red fruit, with cherry, raspberry, and strawberry. No dark fruit here to really speak of. Immediately following is the earthy notes of oak, smoke, and leather. Normally tasting notes of smoke and leather in wine is something that I absolutely love, but the residual sugar, vanilla, and heavier mouthfeel cloud over it all. Medium to medium-high acidity, although the slightly heavier mouthfeel impacts the versatility. 

Not bad, but also not something Iâ€™d buy as a weekday staple. This is a wine you bring to a party as an afterthought. I would drink this if served it, but this will remain a house party ice bucket bottle. 

My current weekday pinot staple remains Pacific Redwoodâ€™s Organic Pinot. At only $17 per bottle, Iâ€™ll gladly pay that small premium to get a much better product, even if it is usually a bitch to find.

Krug Storage - freaking out I ruined my Krug ,0,1gji774,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gji774/krug_storage_freaking_out_i_ruined_my_krug/,31,2024-11-04 23:19:55,"Hi everyone, I need some advice on properly storing Krug that I intended to drink quickly but have now had for a month and will likely not be able to drink for at least another month by the looks of it. 

I originally put the Krug upright in my normal fridge thinking Iâ€™d drink it in a few days so I didnâ€™t bother with immaculate storage precautions. Life got in the way and I donâ€™t want to drink it until the perfect moment (not rushing, etc). So itâ€™s been in the fridge upright for a month now. I donâ€™t have a wine fridge, so I put it back horizontally in the fancy box it came in which is some kind of cardboard with foam padding. Iâ€™m hoping this will provide a layer of insulation against temperature fluctuations of opening and closing the fridge door.  

Will my Krug be ok like this for another month or should I do something differently with the resources I have available at hand. "
Last Night's Wines: 2015 Michel Gonet Millesime Blanc de Blancs Champagne Grand Cru 'Le Mesnil-sur-Oger' & 1972 Taylor Fladgate Late-Bottled Vintage Port,6,1gix24i,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gix24i,1,2024-11-04 03:57:49,"2015 Michel Gonet Millesime Blanc de Blancs Champagne Grand Cru 'Le Mesnil-sur-Oger':

Light straw in color with very fine and light bubbles. 

A bit closed on the nose but gentle aroma of brioche, lime skin, candied lemon, grape soda.

On the palate, brioche, green apple, mandarin, lemon peel, lime cordial, with a bit of flinty minerals on the finish which is very long. 

Overall wanting a bit more on the nose but a very luscious and easy drinking champagne with a beautiful lingering finish.

92+ points.

1972 Taylor Fladgate Late-Bottled Vintage Port:

Deep copper in color, slight cloudiness and small amount of sediment.

On the nose, golden raisin, milk chocolate, caramel, cinnamon, dates.

On the palate, confirming the nose with hints of dried candied orange peel and baking spices.

A bit more diluted, and reflective of a somewhat weaker vintage but enjoyable nonetheless.

89 points"
2004 Gibbston Valley Blanc de Noir,4,1gizcpw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gizcpw,2,2024-11-04 05:38:27,"I am drinking this 20 years too late, but I like venturing and try things for the fun (and learning) of it.  

This is an inexpensive bottle so not expecting anything on the palate.  On the label, it says they ""made using only the highest quality Pinot Noir grapes"", ""delicate salmon colour"" from maceration, ""intense peach watermelon and candyfloss flavours"".

Oxidation, med amber. I see some viscosity as well.
I pick up dried orange slices, dried dates, mushrooms and cedar.
On palate, I want to say old strawberry jam, ginseng, and cinnamon.
Intensity I would have to say low+, low acidity, offdry, short.

I kept it in a small decanter to see if it developed any further, but nothing other than increase in acidity.  Before turning into vinegar, I made into a reduction to top on vanilla ice cream.

Advice: M. Chapoutier Condrieu Schistes d'Agrumes,2,1gj1m83,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gj1m83/advice_m_chapoutier_condrieu_schistes_dagrumes/,7,2024-11-04 07:23:30,"Just wanted to ask for a bit of advice. A liquor store has the wine in the title (2021), which is normally â‚¬42, but is now on discount to â‚¬31.50. It's still a bit of a high price for what I usually want to spend, but I'm willing to spend it on something I think I'll enjoy (e.g. last week I picked up a 2007 Colheita port from Dow's for a similar price that I'm thoroughly enjoying).

I'll explain my tastes so that you have more information to recommend buying/not buying a bottle. I tend to far prefer fortified wine, port especially, but I'm currently in the process of learning more about wine since I want to explore the wine world. I tend to prefer white wine over red. I (somewhat) like chardonnay, but am not a big fan of sauvignon blanc. In terms of red, the ones I like the most are pinotage and shiraz, but don't really like cabernet sauvignon. I also like procescco.

I received a hearty recommendation for Chapoutier from someone I know that very much enjoys wine, and tried a bit of pinot noir from Chapoutier, which was pretty good. That's why I'm considering this bottle. I also bought a bottle of CÃ´tes du Rhone and CÃ´tes du Rhone Blanc from Chapoutier, but those two won't be opened for now (since there are several open bottles that need to be finished first), meaning I don't have a base point of comparison.

Would you guys recommend buying the bottle? Sorry if it's quite a lot of text for what might be an easy yes or no for you, but I'm curious about the wine and don't want to potentially waste my money."

Best QPR in Piedmont?,101,1gid2u7,https://i.redd.it/pimtpk5zllyd1.jpeg,67,2024-11-03 09:33:50,"Reposting because original was removed. 

These are becoming my two go-to Barolos for highest QPR. The Vajra I feel is pretty commonly suggested to punch higher than the price. The Vietti is a staple producer and is hard to go wrong. For between $35-$45 itâ€™s hard to beat this. 

Do you have any suggestions that you feel are better for high QPR in this region?

Notes: I had these both earlier today so I have to  off memory so my post doesnâ€™t get removed. 

Vajra: classic brick Barolo color, bright red cherry, rose, tar, slight licorice. Medium high tannin, medium high acidity. Lots of fresh red fruit, well balanced. 92.

Vietti: Slightly more ruby than brick. Also lots of bright red fruit, tar, almost a meaty scent as well to it. Extremely smooth tannins balanced with a bright acidity. Well balanced and potential to cellar. 93. 

The 2020 year so far is close to 2019. Seriously a great vintage so far, lots of depth and potential to cellar. Still very young but the Barbarescoâ€™s and Langhe Neb are drinking beautifully now.  "

Firm texture I expect of Beaune with forest floor, dried flowers and a hint of barnyard all playing second fiddle to black cherries, macerated strawberries and raspberry notes. All bursting from the glass. Palate is also a mouthful of ripe red fruits with whispers of earth, flowers and spice. Finish is not incredibly long but sufficient to warrant this 1er cru's reputation. After about an hour in the glass, tertiary notes begin to take over and the age shows. The fruit doesn't disappear but it steps into the background for all the earthy funky floral notes to pop out. Onto the Sancerre Rouge. Obviously more a contrast than comparison but wow what a difference! Smoky, dark and brooding. My fiancÃ©, who's notes I love, said it smells like a pirate. Big, big nose wafting out of the glass. Blackberries and cassis, aforementioned smoke, baking spices. Almost smells more Rhone than Loire. Same on the palate. Full bodied, silky tannins, well balanced overall. Ripe fruit, complex secondary notes, long finish. Cheaper than the Burgundy, too. (I suppose that's a given these days.) Both paired quite nicely with Chinese food. (Pinot and Chinese is one of my go-to's.) Cheers!"

Napa Sauv. blanc - help me understand (and possibly help my marriage),14,1ghvs5y,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1ghvs5y/napa_sauv_blanc_help_me_understand_and_possibly/,41,2024-11-02 19:54:58,"Hello!

My wife and I made a trip through Napa valley this summer (first time!) and went to St. Supery based on a recommendation from a friend.  They are well known for their sauvignon blancs, which are spectacular.  We liked their wines so much we joined their club even though we're on the east coast.  We have not EVER joined a club before, so that's how much we liked their stuff.

Fast forward a bit, and we have received a few shipments.  One of these wines - specifically [this one](https://www.stsupery.com/product/2023-rutherford-estate-vineyard-sauvignon-blanc/) \- is causing a disagreement between us.  While the taste is still wonderful, the wine has a strong, pungent, wet wool, dirty sock smell.  It his me in the face...this is not a subtle note.  But, my wife doesn't smell it at all, and thinks I'm nuts.  Usually she's the one that's able to identify flavors and notes more than me, so this is surprising.  This has happened with two different bottles form two different shipments, so I don't think it's related to an anomaly in storage, cork, etc.

I have a few questions for the experts here:

1 - Is this smell unique to the one drinking?  Is this sort of a cilantro/soap situation where I can smell the odor, but my wife is unable?

2 - what can cause this odor?  I've read a few articles that cite the reason as either lightstrike due to improper storage, chemical contamination, or bad yeast.  But, this is above my paygrade to answer.  I can say that we store all the bottles in a medium size, temp controlled wine fridge in our basement.

3 - is this an intended characteristic of the wine?  We've tried a few of the St. Supery Sauvignon Blancs and the Rutherford Estate is the only one that seems to carry this particular nose.

The best wine I have ever tasted,112,1ghfxit,https://i.redd.it/ddrq5n2nucyd1.jpeg,47,2024-11-02 04:06:25,"Ive been lucky enough, through work and a few generous friends, to try some of the â€˜greatâ€™ wines of the world. Iâ€™m talking $250-750/bottle; none of the crazy 1k+ stuff that you have to spend a whole life tasting wine to really appreciate vs something half the price.
Picked this up from an auction house in Cape Town for $90, 10yrs old. Nothing I have drank ever compared. Obviously itâ€™s white and many serious wine drinkers for some reason constrain themselves to red. This was more restrained yet tense than any red wine Iâ€™ve tasted. Canâ€™t imagine drinking it with food, so near-overwhelming is the cascade of flavours.

However, my ""totalwine"" store along with several grocery stores our suddenly out of stock on the blend and burgundy versions. 

I know its seasonal and the good and bad years effect the tastes over the years. But to be sold out completely? I recently read some wine article mentioning people are buying less mass market wines and this has effected its sales along with the growers in California.

I can only assume that this is a cut cost solution by reducing its products and probably phasing out certain brand styles.

Am I wrong here or did some catastrophe happen agriculturely? Just wondering."

Initially muted on the nose but eventually showed sweet oak, caramel and soy sauce/hoisin. Some sweetness on the attack. Dried figs, dark cherries and blackberries, with pleasant notes of undergrowth and mushroom. Quite advanced for 2018 and reflected the warm vintage.

Sweet oak, violets, brambly fruit on the nose. On the palate sour cherries, strawberries, cranberries. Vibrant, zippy acidity with a spicy finish. Exuberant, youthful and beautifully balanced.

Right now, Iâ€™m drinking Firestone Vineyard Merlot and my mouth immediately got itchy. I looked up the ingredients, and sure enough â€” hint of raspberries. After all the research Iâ€™ve done, Iâ€™m still confusedâ€¦

Are there actual berries in red wine, or is the make up of the grape (or grape skin?!) the same enzymes as a raspberry? Enlighten me, please! Make it make sense! I love red wine :("

Open Your Wine Autumn - September and October roundup,14,1ghf6wl,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1ghf6wl/open_your_wine_autumn_september_and_october/,1,2024-11-02 03:33:43,"Some of you may have read my previous post on this topic, but for those of you just tuning in, Open Your Wine Autumn is a new tradition I have inaugurated which is exactly what it sounds like: A season-long excuse to open any wine that needs an excuse for opening, a yearly cure to the plague of ""waiting for a special occasion"" to crack that nice bottle you're sitting on for no compelling reason. As autumn calls to mind the natural cycles of aging and death, the wise wino, never taking life, health, or time for granted, knows to drink up while they still have the chance. Or, to put things in a slightly more grounded way: I get really bored of only ever opening 'responsible' weeknight bottles ad infinitum when I know I've got more exciting stuff sitting in my fridge, and I want to go a little apeshit for going apeshit's sake from time to time.

To that end I have put my modest amount of money where my mouth is and opened a few of the nicer bottles in my collection since September. I've done this on random weeknights, I've had them with burgers and shawarma and Popeye's and Chinese take-out, and I've consumed every one of them on my living room couch, mostly in pajamas. Since I've got until December 21st to keep #OYWA up I've not yet escalated to the bottles I've been most precious about (stay tuned for the December roundup for those), but I have dusted off the far reaches of my wine fridge and cleared out a good number of lovely bottles which had been waiting patiently for anywhere from 1-3 years for me to get around to drinking them.

In no particular order, here is the most recent batch of the wines I have opened so far this autumn in the spirit of OYWA:

\---

Alessandra Divella Dosaggio Zero Rose de Saignee NV - This stuff was incredible, I love good Franciacorta and having really enjoyed Divella's 'NiNi' at the Four Horsemen a year or two ago I was very excited to find another of her zero-dosage wines at a local shop. I didn't take very detailed notes on this ('strawberry' and 'yeast', ok, very helpful, past me) but with a bit of air on it it went from deceptively simple to absolutely screaming with flavor and aroma that'd make any grand cru grower champagne jealous. Not sure what the hell I meant by ""almost carnal"" but that's in my notes too? Fascinating color, a kind of rusty pinkish sultana raisin hue. World class Franciacorta, will be an insta-buy if I ever come across it again. This stuff begs to be paired with a meal; I think I had mine with fried chicken?

Catherine & Pierre Breton 'Les Perrieres' Bourguiel 2015 - This was a slightly shy Cab Franc that really wanted some time in a decanter to start expressing itself, but an absolute pleasure to drink once it did. Serious depth of flavor with your typical herby-peppery raspberry and earth accord, structured but easy drinking (""digestible"" if you like) at the same time. Had it with a burger and mac salad and could not have asked for a better pairing.

Chateau Simone Palette Rouge 2009 - Had been seeing this gathering dust for ages at a local shop and I'm glad I rescued it. One of those interesting southern French blends, mostly Grenache and Mourvedre with a whole hodgepodge of supporting grapes. Reminded me a bit of a Bordeaux at first with its strong red fruit-mineral-leather thing it had going on, but with sufficient air and warmth it started showing really interesting eucalyptus and licorice and garrigue notes. Really beautiful at 15 years and seemed like it would only get better with more age.

Olivier Horiot ""En Valingrain"" Rose des Riceys 2018 - I had the En Barmont a little earlier this year and loved it, and I liked this one even better. Fascinatingly 'textural' Pinot Noir, it has this kind of mercurial combination of density and lightness I find very hard to put into words; at the risk of getting too silly here it has a certain mysterious, magical energy and otherworldly tension to it. In any case I could drink a pail of the stuff; very tasty strawberry and sour cherry notes, herbaceous, a touch of cedar or pencil shavings. Really cool dark ruby color too, the kind of wine you want to look at with a flashlight. If those red health potions you drink in video games were real, this is what drinking one would feel like.

Domaine de l'Enclos Chablis GC 'Vaudesir' 2020 - One of my favorite white wines I've had all year, the kind of Chardonnay that just puts a smile on my face. I was enjoying myself too much to take detailed notes (I recall lemon, mineral, and smoke) but I did note that it was both serious and deep enough I wanted to take my time with it and also delicious and refreshing enough I wanted to neck a liter of it and ask for seconds.

Domaine de la Chevalerie Grand-Mont Bourguiel 2015 - I enjoyed this, although after having sat on it for nearly 3 years I was left wondering why I waited so long as it didn't really feel all that momentous. (That's the benefit of OYWA, I guess.) Interesting lychee black tea and barnyard notes which I find typical of this kind of low-intervention Loire Cab Franc, a bit of spice, raspberry, leather, plum, a bit of earth. Deep purplish-garnet color. If you've had Chevalerie's other offerings you can imagine a somewhat more structured, ageworthy version of those and you'll know exactly what you're in for with this."

I donâ€™t drink much Napa, so I was truly shocked at how heavy bodied and just generally BIG this was. I adore Chinon and CFs from Finger Lakes, so this really threw me off at first sip. In my mind CF is thin, light bodied. This could have passed for a zin or MourvÃ¨dre. Bone dry, high, grippy tannins. Light plum and current on the nose. Biggest flavors were leather, tobacco, dry leaves (maybe the Pennsylvania fall affected my taste buds). Each pour I enjoyed more than the previous. A lovely wine, biggest issue was how it tasted against my expectations, but no issues on its own. A nice drinking experience and it was fun to branch out and just enjoy being surprised by something. âœŒðŸ¼"

Now Iâ€™ve seen from this subreddit that some wines get better with age and others will just stay the same or degrade and that it totally depends on the wine. Will leaving a Madeira wine to sit for a long time make the flavour better? Or will it just remain virtually the same in all those years?

Review: Belle Glos Clark & Telephone Pinot Noir,96,1ggsgoa,https://i.redd.it/q7t2w7efi6yd1.jpeg,56,2024-11-01 06:47:15,"Soâ€¦this says pinot noir on the bottle, but this does *not* taste like pinot noir. This tastes over-extracted and is syrupy in body/mouthfeel. Dark purple in color, much darker than a pinot noir should be. Needless to say, I can immediately tell this is heavily manipulated like Prisoner and Caymus.

Heavy notes of sweet vanilla, and oak thatâ€™s of an unnatural character. The fruit is a non-distinct mix of mostly dark and some red. I can make out lots of blackberry,  and some cherry and smoke.

This is neither elegant or structured. I would honestly look elsewhere for a quality pinot. It doesnâ€™t even taste that good generally. 

This ainâ€™t it. "

Med golden colour

Nose: lots of lees-y, almost champagne-like brioche notes, citrus, and vanilla

Palate: very concentrated, expressive citrus notes (orange peel, lemon), well integrated oak (vanilla, lees characteristics), minerals, very long finish

Beautiful freshness really helps balance out the high alcohol (15%) and oak notes, gives it energy and acidic grip that melts into a long, waxy finish. Not usually a fan of big oaky whites, but that was very moreish. 

Got it on clearance and sad I didnâ€™t get everything they had.

Your favorite Aglianicos,3,1gh7yi1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gh7yi1/your_favorite_aglianicos/,6,2024-11-01 22:23:31,"So I recently got back from a trip to Italy, we were lucky enough to visit Rome and Naples and I made it a point to try some local wines. In my first couple days in Campania I had tried a Taurasi Reserva and another Aglianico and noticed both had a sort of bitter taste or bitter finish that I wasn't enjoying. On a trip out to Amalfi Coast we stopped at Ettori Sammarco, a small winery right on the coast in Ravello. Which I highly recommend stopping in if you're in the area. Very family feel, they have a little tasting counter in the winery and the founder/owner was right there overseeing the work and chatting with us. I believe he is 92 and still involved!I tried some delicious whites and some of their reds and fell in love with their reserve that is 70% Aglianico, 30% Pie de Rosso. It had none of the bitterness and everything I loved about the other wines I had tried. Talking with the host and the owner they mentioned there are multiple types of Aglianicos and the terroir of Ravello is part of why their wines don't have the same bitterness as others. 


I brought some bottles back that I'll sit on for a bit but I'm looking for other recommendations of Aglianicos that don't have that bitter note. As much as I'd love to order direct from Sammarco, ordering by the case with international shipping isn't in my budget at the moment (maybe as a treat down the road). I also get the feeling the other Aglianicos I tried may have been too young and those bitter notes may mellow out of the years. So I'm not opposed to grabbing some bottles to set aside. "

I've been thinking about what to go with (I havenâ€™t had any of them before). Iâ€™m fairly confident about enjoying the reds; Iâ€™ve had Saint-Ã‰milion in a similar price range in the past, and while I liked it, it didnâ€™t leave a lasting impression (so maybe skip? save some money). Iâ€™ve never had a CÃ´te-RÃ´tie, though Iâ€™ve heard excellent things, and I know ChÃ¢teau d'Ampuis has a solid reputation. Iâ€™ve enjoyed Syrah based wines before, so I feel like it could be a good fit.

As for the white, Iâ€™m less familiar with white wines in general but have been intrigued ever since Konstantin Baum introduced the 2012 Ex Voto in one of his videos. The bottle available isnâ€™t a 2012, but Iâ€™m still curious to try it and have high expectations.

Sadly at the moment I don't have any information about vintages, but I expect them to be fairly young ones (towards latest releases if not the latests). It might also be important to mention I don't really plan on aging any of them, might not drink them when they come but soon enough.

On the palate, it has a beautiful unctuous texture like buttermilk floral honey but still with a bright and vibrant acidity and crisp minerality. 
It paired reallt nicely with creamy oysters and grilled lobster on butter-soaked bread.

I'm hosting a Burgundy-themed wine evening tomorrow, and I'm curious as to people's thoughts on whether I should decant the reds.

When I've previously hosted wine evenings, I tend to double-decant the reds a couple of hours beforehand, especially younger reds, to allow them to open up a bit. However, I've got a couple of older wines this time and I'm not certain if I should double decant them. 

Below is my selection of reds from across the CÃ´te de Beaune, CÃ´te Chalonnaise, and CÃ´te de Nuits (in serving order):

* Domaine Denis Carre Bourgogne Hautes CÃ´te de Beaune 2019,
* Moillard Volnay 1er Cru â€˜Les Santenotsâ€™ 2011,

[https://www.gosanangelo.com/story/life/columnists/gus-clemens/2018/11/09/corks-wont-dry-out-if-you-store-wine-bottles-vertically-expert-says/1805625002/](https://www.gosanangelo.com/story/life/columnists/gus-clemens/2018/11/09/corks-wont-dry-out-if-you-store-wine-bottles-vertically-expert-says/1805625002/)

The problem is his study only lasted 5 years and in many of the articles he references the AWRI (but the AWRI says wine should be stored horizontally)

  
[https://www.awri.com.au/industry\_support/winemaking\_resources/storage-and-packaging/post-packaging/transport-and-storage/](https://www.awri.com.au/industry_support/winemaking_resources/storage-and-packaging/post-packaging/transport-and-storage/)

He claims that after a 5 year research project that corks will last almost indefinitely in the upright position.

Obviously that does not make sense as real life wine collectors know all to well the issues with dried up corks.

Does anybody know of any other research proving him right or wrong?

I donâ€™t think traditional tasting notes work for these wines, Iâ€™d have to tell you about the wildly high volatile acidity on the red and the almost too much texture on the white and we would fixate on that and never get to the important part. 

These are emotional wines, thereâ€™s not many producers that can make you feel as much in a wine as Kenjiro does, that doesnâ€™t mean the wines are easy by any means, I think most people would be surprised and probably not understand if they saw just how much VA is in the wines but then you taste them and the only reaction is to smile.

I usually drink a bottle over a few days, so I expect it to get better.  Light bodied, red fruits, a bit of leather maybe and wood.  Fairly short finish with not a lot of complexity.  Not terribly well balanced.  For $20, itâ€™s not bad.  Iâ€™ve only had a handful of Barolos but they were properly aged.

I just turned 21 the other day and to mark my ability to legally purchase a bottle of wine I plan on buying a nice bottle of Bordeaux. I have done a ton of research over the past few months about wine, especially Bordeaux. I'm also pretty familiar with wine because my dad is in the wine business. If I'm being honest though, I'm just starting to appreciate wine, and I don't quite know yet what my personal preferences are. With that being said I want to buy a bottle of Bordeaux to start my cellar with. I narrowed my search down to 2 wines 2020 Figeac or 2020 Chateau Ducru-Beaucaillou. If I am going with rankings, WA gave the Figeac 100 points (My dad says WA is the best ranking followed by WS). On the other hand, I think the Ducru Beaucaillou is a little more elegant which I think is more my style(I just don't know yet for sure though). Another major criteria I have is which wine will be ready first. I would like to drink these wines within the decade. Does anyone have any thoughts? I do plan on buying a few other cheaper wines to get started but I wanted a nice bottle to store. Sorry for the long post I just don't know what direction I should go.

I found intense tart cranberry and pomegranate on the nose, with anticipation of what I can only describe as â€œcrunchyâ€ taste if you were to eat those fruits straight-up.   A chalky, mineral finish rounded it out.  

This hit the spot for us, and looking forward to trying some of their Pinots next.

Back in 2001/2002, my husband and I stopped in, tried some of their wines, and bought a few. One that we really enjoyed was their late harvest Symphony dessert wine (vintage 2000), despite not being dessert wine people at all. We drank one bottle later in our vacation in San Francisco, and brought some others home to the east coast. 

All these years later, we still had one bottle of that Late Harvest Symphony hanging around. After so many years, we assumed it had gone bad, but didnâ€™t want to toss it out, but also never had the desire to open it. 

Until tonight. 

Neighbors came over to celebrate my husbandâ€™s birthday, brought dessert, and I suggested this as the night we open the very old wine. And it wasâ€¦.

Not as bad as we expected! Not as good as we remembered, but it was drinkable. 

Still had faint traces of the apricot, peach, and pear we remembered. Lost the florals. Had some port-like notes. Not terrible for a 24-year old wine! Hats off to the winemaker. ðŸŽ©

I have roughly 40 bottles of wine, nothing insanely valuable, but some gems from Heitz, Dunn, etc from 2012-14. All of it is high-quality California or Oregon red wine that I hope to open in 5-20 years.

My fiancÃ© and I moved out of Denver this summer and left the wine in thermal fridge tote bags underneath a friends bed where itâ€™s roughly 69-71Â° in perpetuity and in the dark. We moved to Austin, and the moving company wouldnâ€™t take the wine. 

1) what damage is being done to the wine at that temperature? Itâ€™s been there three months. It is a mix of Pinot Noir and Cab Sauv
2) what is the most economical and safe way to get the wine to Texas?

The whole collection might be worth $5,000-7,000 - I am not really interested in high-end wine shipping, but I donâ€™t want to fly up to Colorado and rent a car to bring it down to Texas. I am considering securely packing it up and checking it on a United flight across 3-4 boxes. I am confident that a â€œfragileâ€ sticker and proper packing would ensure its safety on the plane to about 99%. I could also just tough it out and rent a car one-way and make the drive, costing me probably $600 in plane, gas, and car rental.

I understand if you donâ€™t like specific sweet varieties of wine like dessert wines or semi-sweet reds or whites, but every Riesling Iâ€™ve ever had was dry, and it seems most available are dry. 

I thought this was just an American thing that by imports/marketing Riesling has a reputation of being â€œsweetâ€. But even in Europe, people also seem to have this perspective in my experience.

With spicy Indian food you say, how inappropriate. This was only used during early appetizers, and have to say the spices counterintuitively did not overwhelm the wines. 

Confirmed yet again, Burgundy is all about the producer. I recall buying a case of this at under $50 a bottle long ago. Just a couple left, was worried its past its prime but definitely not so. "

I am relatively new to wine and havenâ€™t developed great vocabulary for what I am tasting, but I loved how â€˜crispâ€™ the Gramercy Cellars was but still had a depth of darker fruit almost savory taste was. The Unnamed Series was great because it felt like over the course of the evening like I was drinking 3 separate wines. When I first opened it it had the same crispness I liked in the Gramercy bottle, but then changed to an almost smoky flavor. After about another hour the smoke gave way to a really delicious funky fruity wine. Really great stuff. 

All of this has made me extremely curious about other Walla Walla producers. My first question is: in my researching these bottles I have noticed people say rocks Syrah has a distinct funk. I am assuming thatâ€™s what I liked in the second bottle. Do other grapes besides Syrah exhibit this funky flavor from Rocks producers? My second question is i am looking for recommendations for wines similar to the ones i described.

Wonderful notes of cassis, flint and spice on the nose. Wonderful fruit on the palate cherry, spices and beautiful soft tannins. Finish lingered with strawberries and minerality for 90 seconds.
This wine had years left. I opened a 2000 a year earlier and it was a lot more tired. Wine truly is a wonder thing."

2018 V12 Cabernet Sauvignon

Pulled and poured

Super rich jam, tobacco and a bit of dustiness on the nose initially, florals breaking through after 30-45 minutes in the glass

On the palate itâ€™s a bit muted to start, thereâ€™s some blackberry, tart cherries and some vanilla. Tannins are polished, plenty of acid here (probably from the hillside elevations of the vineyard) but not overwhelming, finish is long with toasty oak and spices, paired well with some Japanese bbq marinated flap loin cooked on the grill."

Over the last year or so, Iâ€™ve really gotten into liking wines, reading about them and tasting them - but only whites. Mainly because I prefer whites, but also because I have an easier time distinguishing notes and differentiating the wines. I especially find Rieslings interesting, as the wines are incredibly versatile (I love crisp Riesling from Mosel, especially ones only harvested and made 1-2 years ago). NZ Sauvignons are also a favorite of mine (I prefer crisp, acidic, fruity and dry whites.) 

But reds just seem so much more difficult and hard to grasp? Where do I start? What grapes/areas? Also the notes and palates - for some reason I just do not find it as easy as smelling/tasting them on whites. How do I get going? 

I do drink reds - and like them - but the knowledge is very basic (I know I like Pinots). 

What would your tip be? How do I get good at reds. Thanks! ðŸ·"

I only visit this subreddit and donâ€™t really know where else to post this, and this is something I am really struggling with.

Â 

I come from an environment where drinking is considered normal. This goes for not just my family, but basically everyone I grew up with. Parents of friends down the street, social gatherings like birthdays, diner parties. Ever since I was a kid, almost all the adults in my life drank alcohol. A considerable portion of the friends I have now, also like to drink. Not all are heavy drinkers, but if I am being honest it feels like I am verging on the edge of alcoholism myself and I know for a fact both my parents are and have been alcoholics for a long time.

Â 

What â€˜kept me in the darkâ€™ for a long time is that no-one around me really seemed to be compromised in their daily lives because of this life-style. Functioning addicts (not all of them, but still), so to speak. If I am being honest (again) I also donâ€™t see the problem in drinking whatever amount if itâ€™s someoneâ€™s choice and it doesnâ€™t come with harmful consequences for that person or his/her surroundings.

Â 

However, someone really close to me has developed a condition which really has damaged the way I view this person, and at time makes me want to cut him/her out of my life for good. Thus, the reason of this post.

Â 

Is it possible for some-one who has been drinking all his/her life to develop a sort of allergy of alcohol?

Â 

The person I am referring to may be having a pleasant conversation with you, but as soon as the first glass of wine is consumed things take a turn. The visual aspects of someone who is completely drunk are recognizable immediately (which is â€˜too soonâ€™) but even worse, the personâ€™s whole character seems to change. The same anecdotes are told back to back. Mean verbal jabs are made. His or her opinion on things are really extreme, but seem to be completely random, like the real â€˜he or sheâ€™ is completely gone.

Â 

It's just like the tolerance is completely gone, and a sort of super random auto-pilot takes over. I know it sounds like I am describing someone who is black-out drunk but like I said, this occurs after just one glass of wine, and this person has been drinking all his/her life. Can you drink away your tolerance to the point you are just a completely different person?"

So fresh and precise still this could go longer easily.

Triolet 2020 - Less salinity and complexity, this was a challenging vintage. Similar lemon and lime but also a little grassy yet a little brighter than the 2015. Citrus galore on the palate, however feels thinner and less complex. 

Triolet 2022 - The standout for the Triolet here, this one is so well integrated. Has complexity beyond the 2015 and also tastes older than the 2015. Zippy yet creamy and well balanced. 2022 is a great vintage.

Chardonnay 2020 - Buttery and rich on the nose, refreshing salinity and yellow fruits. Still great complexity for this challenging year. 

Chardonnay 2021 - Like the 2020 but more fresh, more acidity and more fruit forward. A buffed up version of the 2020.

Chardonnay 2022 - Okay so what a vintage for the whites this is, so complex and drinking well beyond its years. This is a standout and so well integrated already, this would be exciting to revisit in 10 years. 

Marli Russell 2021 - A new endeavour by Mount Mary focusing on Rhone varieties grown and vinified at the estate. Big red fruit nose, core of strawberry and jam, smells like a farmers market. The palate is light and fresh with strawberry, cranberry, light as a feather, wow! Young Grenache vines so itâ€™s less concentrated fruit and lacks the earthiness you expect from a GSM. 

Marli Russell 2022 - This one has darker fruits, jammy plum and boysenberry, very brooding on the nose. Palate similar to the 2021 but more concentrated fruits. 

Pinot Noir 2021 - Very excited, my favourite Australian Pinot, feels like its weightless on the nose, dark red fruit core, porcelain on the palate itâ€™s so delicate, floats effortlessly with a trio of strawberry, slight pepper and vanilla pods.

Quintet 2014 - Deep and concentrated, blackcurrant and boysenberry with dried vanilla pods. Dark and ripe red fruits converging on a medium body. 10 years on and could still go a long way! 

Quintet 2017 - More liquorice and pronounced red fruits compared to the 2014, I get a little eucalyptus too. This one could almost fool me as Margaret River in a blind tasting. 

Quintet 2021 - Lost the eucalyptus note entirely, more earthy with deep red fruits with much more concentration. Excellent balance, great oak and vanilla perfectly integrated.

Quintet 2022 - More vanilla pronounced, thinner body on the palate but fresh and vibrant still with ripe red fruits."

In the privileged position of being a semi-retired physician with time including for travel, and have some capital. I would become a wine ""professional"" just to do this. I'm banned by my luckily more-sensible wife from starting or investing in a hobby winery so what else could I do to work or contribute to the wine world? I currently help a friend in her warehouse winery as needed but it needs to be a real role (i.e. 20+ hours a week). I'm in Australia.

It doesn't have to make money. I doubt the world needs more amateur wine writers. Ideas I've had... I could go in as an investor if a friend with industry experience starts a wine bar. Non profit? I have lots of contacts in the Middle East and could do something somehow helping winemakers in marginal areas?? Doing boutique imports is probably the easiest to initiate from a mechanical point of view but sounds capital-intensive, low and possibly negative margin and generally a pain in the ass unless I actually tried to scale it up. Would involve tax-deductible travel and probably good home drinking in direct proportion to sales failure but I'm under no illusions as to the glamour (my father shipped industrial material around the world and it seemed very painful).

Any ideas?

First time trying old wine (Lafite 1988),141,1gckn96,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gckn96,40,2024-10-26 20:05:04,"Tried 3 different vintages of Lafite during the Decanter Masterclass in Singapore. 

2018 was very tight and tannic with primary fruits dominating both the aroma and palette. Can see how the wine will be elegant and great in the future. 

2008 was more advanced but still had great structure and started to show more softness but still had the primary fruit core. 

1988 was the one that made me go â€˜what the hell!?!?â€™ The first sniff I took almost made me gag. The barnyard funk was so strong that I thought I put my head into a pail of horse shit. Honestly, Iâ€™m not sure if this is representative of what older Bordeaux wines taste like. But it was quite revolting. The speaker remarked that we have to look past the barnyard funk to see the underlying tertiary notes. At this point, I was seriously questioning if the wine was corked or spoilt but it was my first time trying a 30+ yo wine and everyone around me didnâ€™t say anything so I didnâ€™t want to raise any questions lol. 

For those of you whoâ€™ve tried this vintage in recent years or have had experience with much older Bordeaux reds, is it common to have such a strong barnyard funk (smelling like horse shit)? Personally I didnâ€™t find it enjoyable so idk maybe itâ€™ll be something I have to experience more to appreciate. "

We are both fairly new to wine and haven't delved too much into the Old World. We loved how much we learned about the process and grew a much deeper love and respect for wine. 

The 1993 Vouvray, we only bought because that is our birth year and it was only 6â‚¬. It was the oldest white that I have had and it was a lot in the mouth. Tasted like I took a mouth full of dirt and chased it with some mushroom water. Definitely wasn't a favorite. 

We weren't in Bordeaux long, only 2 and a half days and only got one wine tour in at St. Emillion. I wish we would have been able to spend more time in this area as there was more things to see and wine to try than we had time for. 

This is the haul that we came home with. Our main goal was to get a bottle with the intention to save it for our 15 year anniversary. We chose the 2020 Chateau Martet. We loved this wine when we tried it at the shop. Had the tasting notes of dark cherry, vanilla, and licorice. 

Happy with our haul and can't wait to go back!"

Initially super strong and high tannins, but mellowed out and fruit notes came out.

Notes of cherry pits, raspberry, strawberry stems, aloe vera, green peppercorn, orange skin. 

Definitely a powerful wine, doesn't taste hot, but you can tell it's strong from an alcohol perspective.

Paired well with spicy vegetarian nachos. 

I love this wine, it's a tiny notch below the Shakti, but that may just be age. 

As a bonus, saved half a glass for the next day and it opened up even more! Would definitely decant for a minimum three hours before touching this.

Just wanted to share a few pics of the Port Capital of the World: Duoro. This place really needs to be seen to believed. The slopes that hold the port grape are steep and rock solid. Slate and Shist rock battle for the grape vines of Pedro Xemenez and many other varietals. The people of the Duoro are lovely, hard working, life long devotees of their task, climbing these rocky slopes with wine baskets to harvest these grapes. 

After touring most of the wineries, my favorites are Sandemans and Dow, but other smaller, less well-known producers are also fantastic. 

I cook with 10 year tawny (pork with red wine vinegar, safe and port are my go-to) and drink 20 and 30 year tawny. 

If you love Port, make it a point to visit this beautiful region. It's well worth the long drive, side of the road, precipice gazing at the vertical slopes and amazing cellars of these vineyards. Cheers!

This isn't likely to be super expensive stuff, and I'd be keeping things for around 5-10 years, not decades. As an example I recently bought 3 cases of Chateau Teyssier (Montagne St Emilion) 2019, at a cost of EUR12/bottle which I expect will improve over the next 5 years. 

I've previously dabbled with home-brewing beer, and ""made"" a temperature controlled fermentation chambre using a tried and tested DIY approach: a fridge, with a small 60W tubular electric heater placed inside, the fridge and heater both wired into a thermostatic controller which turns one or the other on to maintain the temp within a set range. For home-brew this was around 19-21 degrees C, but it would be easy to adjust this to say 12-15 degrees C.

I'm wondering if something like this would work rather than spending Â£100's on a purpose-build wine fridge (esp. given the type/value of wine I'd be storing).

Old Napa Cab + Sashimi = Heaven,72,1gc7jde,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gc7jde,54,2024-10-26 06:16:34,"1996 Clos Du Val paired beautifully with our first course, Katsuo or bonito tataki (lightly seared on the outside) with an onion sauce and wasabi.

A tad hot when we first opened it but the alcohol dissipated within 10 minutes to reveal softened tannins and notes of preserved plums, dark stone fruits, distressed leather and earth. It lifted the oily/fishiness of the bonito. Might have clashed with the sweetness of the onion but otherwise an ideal pairing. 

Sushi Gyoshin in Honolulu is a must and they are BYOB for now, so itâ€™s fun to try different things with each course. The wait is about 3 months out right now so book in advance if you can. "
Not enough BlaufrÃ¤nkisch around here....,138,1gc2o32,https://i.redd.it/lcukctttfywd1.jpeg,27,2024-10-26 02:34:17,"So it's time to change that! This beauty comes from the Eisenberg region of the southern Burgenland. Wachter-Wiesler are a well established producer from there, making BlaufrÃ¤nkisch in a terroir-driven style that focuses on refinement and freshness. The wine hails from the Weinberg vineyard in the village of Deutsch-SchÃ¼tzen. It has a souther exposition and its soil consists of iron rich clay. After spontaneous fermentation and spent 34 months in a large oak casks.

I aerated the wine for about 1 1/2 hours after opening and served it in a Spiegelau Definition Bordeaux glass. It has an opaque ruby colour and garnet rim.

On the nose the wine presents itself with dark fruity aromas at first, think of luxardo cherry, sloe and plum. Soon after, more savoury notes take control, hallmark notes of Eisenberg BlaufrÃ¤nkisch like blood and iodine come through immediately. The wine then also presents notes of crushed stones, undergrowth and black pepper. Furthermore, a well integrated hint of barnyard funk, citrus and earth envelope the wine.

The palate shows intense fruit of sloe and dark cherry at first, minerality and earthy notes come through as well. A very fresh acidity and structured, but not overpowering tannins add structure. A long finish brings the wine to an end, showing notes of luxardo cherry, meat juices, leather and herbal tones.

Another Eisenberg-banger after the Weninger Saybritz for me! It shows a perfect interplay of fruity, savoury and lightly spicy notes at this point of development. It also has still a lot of life still in it, so extended aging would also be an option. If you enjoy BlaufrÃ¤nkisch of this style, definitely give it a try!"
The Wine List at Core by Clare Smyth seems a bit confused about Australia ,33,1gcbjf9,https://i.redd.it/b1ry6rp3m0xd1.jpeg,20,2024-10-26 09:53:01,"This map of Australia on page 65 of the wine list from 3-Michelin Star â€˜Core by Clare Smythâ€™ has bemused me for ages. Iâ€™ve never been, but lived vicariously through a friend who went during Covid lockdown; the food and experience was reportedly incredible. 

Besides putting Perth about 900km too far north, the map of Western Australia seems to think an area of mostly arid desert around the size of Italy is all wine-country (if only!). 

I sent an email about this years ago but - despite numerous revisions to the list - the map remains unchanged, and so does my minor irritation.

Still, always good to have Margaret River and The Great Southern represented on such a brilliant list!"
Ideal Wine Cellar Inventory According to Little's Law,24,1gcbvpu,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gcbvpu/ideal_wine_cellar_inventory_according_to_littles/,13,2024-10-26 10:13:37,"Little's law is a quick way to determine the optimal number of widgets in a process, whether it is a part in a manufacturing process, or a bottle in a wine cellar. 

The law says that the number of inventory items during steady state is equal to the average processing time (holding period) multiplied by the consumption rate.

Steady Inventory = Holding Period X Consumption Rate

For example. If I consume 52 bottles of wine per year, and I want to cellar each bottle for an average of 5 years, my ideal cellar inventory is 52x5=260.

More than 260 bottles means I won't consume enough before they age out, less than 260 means I'm consuming more than what my target holding period will allow. 

It's a simple way to perform a gut check for the ""how much is too much?"" question regarding how much wine to buy and cellar. "

Nose: citrus mushroom cream. gf said â€œ white wineâ€ 

Story: in the early 1990s we planted a beautiful rolling 68 acres site to Chardonnay here in Carneros in the cool southernmost part of Napa Valley it established our vineyard using sustainable farming practices. in 1994 we harvested our first fruit. this vintage celebrates 25 years of wine produced from the Chardonnay grown in our spectacular sight. 

Taste: round smooth almost perfect if it jumped out to me more. Cream, citrus, butter but not in a bad overoaked way. Itâ€™s balanced itâ€™s sturdy. Itâ€™s strong. Low acid, brioche lemon zest. Honestly such a balanced good wine itâ€™s hard to describe. 

Price: free but retails around $70 bucks think

Points: 94 I think. Itâ€™s honestly just so pure and smooth idk what to rate it. Itâ€™s such a good easy wine. If I could give this to someone to who says they hate California chard itâ€™d 100% change their mind. "

Pictured wines start with Petit Mouton, then Mouton â€˜09, then â€˜05, then Barsac â€˜08.

Here are my notes, with an albeit stuffy nose :(

Pastourelle de Clerc Milon 2020

meaty, austere, drinking well for its age. slight herbaciousness
88 points

Ch Clerc Milon 2018
More fruit than 2nd label, soft tannins, has 2% Carmenere which is very interesting .
94-95 points

NOTE: after tasting through everything in this wild lineup, the value/QPR of Clerc Milon really stood out to me!! I wish I took more detailed notes on this.

Ch d Armailhac 2015
soft nose, but not extremely expressive. fruit was there but a bit one dimensional. long lasting finish. 93 pts

Petit Mouton 2010
dark color, but the garnet is starting to appear on the edges
nose not as pronounced but came out a bit - likely just needed to open up
palate was fantastic. black cherry, dark fruit, slight graphite, vanilla,  tannis were present and a bit grippy. meaty and vanilla finish. this wine is about to enter its prime, if it isnâ€™t already. finish was long and enjoyable. 
95-96 pts


Mouton Rothschild 2009
color: still dark but the tawny look around the edges
nose: pronounced, black currant, dark and lightly stewed fruits
mouth: extremely silky, balanced, slightly warm, pronounced cherry, fresh vanilla, looong finish - creme brulee, vanilla, cherry. lasted 10 minutes if not longer

the finish specifically developed in my mouth - i wish we decanted!
97 pts - but i think if this was decanted it would reach 98

Mouton Rothschild 2005
dark and tawny color
nose: stewed fruit, some vanilla, toasted nuts
palate: fresh fruit on the edge of the palate that morphs into a somewhat stewed fruit on the center of the palate. still a good structure - this wine is in its early prime (for my palate) tannins are present and silky, but  leaves a grip that wants me wanting so much more.

97 pts - also probably needed a decant


Personally, â€˜09>â€™05, but they were both excellent.


Chateau Coutet Sauternes-Barsac 2008
nose: pear, citrus, ginger which allows the flavor to pierce through the nose
palate: the candied ginger is so awesome on this. it has all your classic sauternes notes, but the way the ginger makes this so unique has me really happy with this.

A Warning about RareStorage (K&Ls shipping affiliate) ,28,1gc6bha,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gc6bha/a_warning_about_rarestorage_kls_shipping_affiliate/,14,2024-10-26 05:17:52,"Update: I usually hate this kind of thing, but I donâ€™t want to put any business on blast if they donâ€™t deserve it. K&L left me a voicemail informing me they have refunded me in full. 

I was really happy to learn recently that K&L had a shipping affiliate that shipped to other states than CA. They're called RareStorage and the shipping rates seemed really reasonable. I filled up a couple cases of wine, paid for shipping and insurance and since then it has been a nightmare. 

They shipped my wine through GLS, who proceeded to drop my wine off in a different state than the one I live in. Now, nobody seems to know where it is, or when it will get to my house. K&L can't really help, although they have tried and their customer service is excellent, but RareStorage is a separate company. RareStorage won't talk to you on the phone and so you rely on email correspondence. They provided me with a new tracking number yesterday that was incorrect which further complicated things. I contacted GLS, who has assured me twice now that their operations team will contact me. That hasn't happened.

To K&Ls credit, they have really tried to help, but it seems their hands are tied. It also sounds like RareStorage uses different shipping companies for different states, so you could get lucky and have your wines shipped via UPS or Fed-Ex depending on your location. If you're considering having wines shipped through RareStorage, I would first inquire about which shipping company they'll use to get the wines to you. Also - for my state, there was not an overnight or 2 day shipping option. That probably should have raised red flags in itself, but by the time I realized that, it was too late. 

I know plenty of people here have had good experiences with K&L, and this really isn't their fault. But I did want to give the community a heads up that their affiliate is less commendable and your mileage may vary, depending on where you live. "

New to wine in general, brought back two bottles of champagne from a recent trip I was hoping to store for five years. Can I just vacuum seal the entire sealed champagne bottle and shove it in a normal fridge? I was reading that normal fridges get too dry which is bad for the cork and keeping the storage trouble free. I was thinking that by vacuum sealing the entire bottle it would keep humidity steady even in a normal fridge. The other solution I thought of was maybe wax dipping the top of the bottle which I would think would make it a more consistent humidity level.

I know nothing, y'all know a lot. Please help a brother out if you have a minute. I did try searching around in the sub but the closest I found to an answer was talking about slowing/stopping the aging of the wine using a vacuum bag, which is not what I'm looking to do.

Medium to medium plus body, rich, unctuous, close to if not bone dry, medium acid but still pleasingly crisp, with notes of unsalted popcorn, yellow apple, Asian pear, fresh unripe pineapple, clementine skin, and chalk. Very slight tannic grip from oak aging, and overall the oak here is forward but well integrated. Intensely long finish with green apple and white nectarine, toasty oak. After about 2 hours of air, additional secondary notes of toasted almonds and cinnamon come through towards the finish. 

A gorgeous bottle of white wine and very solid example of the Chassagne-Montrachet style.

I'm looking for tips, tricks and/or tactics for remembering wine details. 

I have just started as a somm and am finding that it is difficult to get all the details locked down for the wines. I am expected to remember the winemaking and tasting notes for all of the BTG and Pairing wines but I keep getting things mixed up or just can't seem to lock it into memory.

 For example, Elk Cove Pinot Noir comes from 6 sites that are fermented separately in stainless steel and blended then matured in French oak for 10 months, using Pommard and Dijon clones. Then I'll have Hartford Court Chardonnay from Russian River Valley in Sanoma that is barrel fermented with 28% new French oak and aged for 9.5 months with weekly lees string and goes through full malolactic conversion. 

  
Two very different wines, made in very different ways but when I have to remember those details for 20, 30, 40 plus wines I find that I get aging times mixed up or the blend mixed up and so on, especially if the wines are similar. 

  
Wondering if anyone out there has ideas for how to get these things memorized. Event if its seems simple, I am just trying to pool different ideas I could adopt.

Corked Young Burgundy? ,1,1gc3ner,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gc3ner/corked_young_burgundy/,7,2024-10-26 03:16:41,"So Iâ€™ve had at least two bottles recently of young and fairly inexpensive burgundy wine that tastes like cherry soda(from Kermit Lynch and shipped to NC). It has been almost effervescent and the cork makes a noticable pop out of the bottle. The nose is still classic burgundy, but the taste is just off for me. I have traveled to Burgundy and tasted real burgundy wine, including some premier cru level stuff. so I think I know what good Burgundy should taste like, and this isnâ€™t really it. I realize at the price point itâ€™s not going to be comparable to Gevrey-Chambertin, but Iâ€™m wondering if the wine Iâ€™m opening is corked or if it is just a function of the price point? "

Is stem inclusion in Pinot Noir the new overly-oaked Chardonnay?,37,1gbcdlg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gbcdlg/is_stem_inclusion_in_pinot_noir_the_new/,32,2024-10-25 03:22:16,"OK sorry for the clickbait title. 

But seriously, has anyone else feeling like there's been a huge increase in noticeably whole cluster fermented/stem included pinot noirs lately? I know it's not a new technique by any means, but in my memory it used to be something that added an extra je ne sais quoi to a vintage that maybe needed some help with complexity, not hit you over the palate stem-y chewy. If the first thing I notice when tasting a pinot is if it's had stem contact or not, IMO it's gone too far. Specifically on American pinots, which I get a fairly broad exposure to through work, feels like recently the volume has been turned up to 11. Maybe my palate is just super sensitive to it and no one else is noticing this trend. Do I need to start a ABSCP (anything but stem contact pinot) club to join the ABC club?"

Casanova di Neri & Tenuta Il Poggione were decanted for 2.5 hours before drinking and the Le ragnaie was poured out in the glass and we started drinking it after 45 mins .

to me the winner among these wines tonight is definitely the casanova di neri , come close at second place , le ragnaie 2019 which did not opened up as I hope during the night 

on the nose the 2018 casanova di neri is simply beautiful ,notes : plum , cherry , oaky , chocolate , tobacco , spice  , tannins are very well integrated .

ended the night with a bottle of Tokaji i brought back from my trip to Budapest , sold by Faust Wine Cellar . I have not tasted alot of tokaji or dessert wine , but this bottle is absolutely delightful to be paired with the pandan swissroll . perfect ending to the night

35th Birthday Party - what am I pulling from the Eurocave?,18,1gb66la,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gb66la,67,2024-10-24 23:02:40,
My Mt. Etna experience and the regionâ€™s parallels with Burgundy,181,1gateoa,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gateoa,35,2024-10-24 10:31:16,"I just got back from Sicily for my honeymoon, and as part of the trip that I got to plan we visited two wineries: Benanti and Girolamo Russo. Both had fantastic wines with great tour guides/somms that took you through a flight of 5 or 6 of their wines. What made the latter visit extra special however was getting to experience some of the harvest of their Nerello Mascalese grapes. 
As you might know, things go a little differently in Europe and you canâ€™t just stop by unannounced at the tasting room, you need to email them and reserve a time slot for a good 2-3 hr or longer experience likely to be paired with multiple courses and/or walks through the vineyard. 
Benantiâ€™s wines and historic production house turned modern showcase are impressive, with a large old wooden press and art adorning the rooms that had a sort of royal, medieval vibe to them, only surrounded by lava rocks. We tasted a beautiful sparkling metodo classico brut Rosato (that they no longer make or at least sell and distribute past 2020), a contrada bianco, a 10 yr old Nerello Cappuccio, and 2 more reds including a 2011 Serra Della Contessa, probably their most prized vineyard boasting centenarian vines behind the property on the side of a SE facing hill. This was all paired with thoughtfully paired food courses for each person. We didnt have the Pietra Marina, but I left with two 2019s after reading and hearing first hand how ageworthy it is.
Girolamo Russo is a newer winery with their own unique story that I wonâ€™t get into here, but the tour was incredibly special. The woman leading our experience let us work the sortable table before taking us through each of their main vineyards by having us follow in our rental car within the different contrade, or sub zones. We eventually walked up to their current tasting room if you can call it that, for their entire lineup including a metodo classico and pet-nat I didnâ€™t know they made. All these wines were just as impressive, each having their own character depending on the contrada they represented. 

After touring the vineyards I remember being struck by all parallels to Burgundy: the lava rock walls surrounding all the vineyards, much like a clos; thereâ€™s many different producers working in the same contrada, and Mt Etnaâ€™s wines are extremely elegant and mineral, with red and white expressions made from mostly single varietal grapes (especially the higher end bottles). I even remember thinking I could totally mistake Girolamo Russoâ€™s San Lorenzo Bianco for a high quality 1er cru Chablis. When I mentioned some of this to our somm she replied, â€œyou know they call it the Burgundy of the South!â€ She wasnâ€™t kiddingâ€”after looking back at the World Atlas of Wine, Jancis Robertson says â€œSome see it as the new CÃ´te dâ€™Or, and vine holdings are similarly parcellated.â€ 
Thereâ€™s a lot incredible wine there, with many relatively newer wineries tending some diverse and exciting terroir. And if you love bubbles, especially rose, thereâ€™s amazing QPR to be had there too! Vintage bottles of metodo classico brut rosato aged on its lees for 2-3 years can be found everywhere in shops for â‚¬25-30"

Snagged this at auction and have been excited to crack it! This wine is a blend of around 75% mourvÃ¨dre, 14% grenache and smaller amounts of cinsault, carignan and syrah (shiraz).

An enticing pale ruby colour. The nose is very aromatic with fruit cake, dried figs, cherry, and olive brine supported by an earthiness with some mushroom and lager.  

A light body with some light acidity right out the bottle complimented by very fine chalky tannins which dissipate over the second pour. Immediately getting sour cherries with strawberries and red currants. The secondary earthiness is also present with that great mushroom and cured meat which gives it that classic French savoury feel. Dark red fruits emerge with some air and are persistent through the finish. 

This is delicious, I fuck with Bandol, especially this cuvÃ©e."

* Aged whites are worth looking into for more interesting
* If it's some weird (not popular) grape variety, it's worth a shot
* I usually limit my regions and countries so I don't have too many variables so I can know what to expect a little more flavor wise - as regions within countries can be so different (like South Africa)

Despite my being able to find no flaw - everything was in balance, the tannins were pleasant, acid was appropriate, and they made no mistakes such as being too fruit-forward or having a weird finish - this wine made me bored. 

What can I tell you about its character? Nothing, I could not detect any. The nose? Your basic Bordeaux nose, albeit in more restrained intensity than I expected.

Decanted for about half an hour and then drunk over the next hour, it might have opened up given more time but it didn't ""feel"" like a tight wine waiting to uncoil. 

I'd happily drink it anytime it was offered, but I think I will forget this wine sooner than I'll seek it out."

I'm relatively into my wine but the crowd ranges massively in terms of knowledge and palate so want to be as inclusive as possible while keeping things interesting. Maybe introducing something to people that they've never tried before. 

Anyone been in this situation and had any bottles or regions that have been a particularly big hit?

Debating bringing a cooler climate white like German Riesling or similar. Maybe a GewÃ¼rztraminer.

I am based in London so plenty of options to choose from.

Related, if there are any great ways / themes / ideas to encourage guests to bring a range of wine that would be grand! "

Poggio di Sotto Brunello di Montalcino 2017

Decanted and drank over two hours. 

My first experience with this legendary Brunello producer and it did not disappoint.

2017 has an unfair rep as a ""bad"" vintage, but I think 2017 Brunello from good producer is still good Brunello and, very importantly, pretty ready to drink now. This isn't for aging over decades (save that for the 2016s and 2019s).

Initially pretty tannic, but with air, really opened up.

Notes of red cherry, red plum, chestnut, soil. Over time, the fruit notes came to the forefront.

Really lovely wine that could benefit from further aging, but is already approachable.

93 points.

Daniel Rion & Fils Vosne-Romanee Les Chaumes 1er Cru 2017

Ready to drink now. Needs a little air, but not heavy decanting (although I did decant it).

Very fruit-forward Bourgogne, ripe fruit, bright cherry notes. 

Nose is almost perfumey with floral notes of rose and cherry blossom. Almost reminds me of my wife's perfume. 

Drinking lovely now.

Very fun experience and would drink both again any day of the week! "

Subtle spices of vanilla and pepper, alongside a touch of cinnamon, create a layered complexity, while refreshing notes of mint and licorice add intrigue. I love the playful hints of orange peel and candied zest that linger in the background.

On the palate, itâ€™s a true delight. The wine is full-bodied yet effortlessly elegant, with well-integrated tannins and vibrant acidity that make each sip a pleasure.

Are Vinotemp wine fridges still considered a good budget pick?,5,1gamejh,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gamejh/are_vinotemp_wine_fridges_still_considered_a_good/,7,2024-10-24 04:49:28,"I saw this 157-bottle Vinotemp for sale at Lowe's for just $630 - nothing seems to be even close to that price for a similar capacity. I'd heard some reports of failure after a couple years in general for this brand, but I'd think any brand besides Eurocaves carries that risk - if it lasts even 6-8 years I'd consider it a win for this price. The side-loading bottle layout could also be problematic for some bottle sizes, but even staggering bottles the capacity should be sufficient for the price.

Explosion of red berries on the nose. Like a smoothy of raspberries that is deliciously inviting. Background notes of sagebrush and dessert shrubs but really the raspberries stole all my attention.

On the palate, you immediately think bright red fruits that give a full mouth feel but without making you exhausted with it being a typical CA red wine. It was bright and lovely and balance with a nice acidity. The finsih went on for days, like a treat.

Overall it's a classy example of Anderson Valley pinot noir. Really love to drink on its own but I snacked on some charcuterie and truffle cheese, which was perfect.

94/100. I regret I didn't pick up a second bottle.

Stomachache by wine only,0,1ga335r,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1ga335r/stomachache_by_wine_only/,14,2024-10-23 12:34:09,"Hey everyone,

I'm from Germany, specifically from the Riesling region, where wine is a big part of the culture. Funny enough, I noticed pretty early on that I can't really handle wine. Where Iâ€™m from, itâ€™s common to mix white wine with water to make a refreshing spritzer, so I didn't think much about it growing up since it was always diluted.

As I got older, I moved away from white wine and started trying red wines, but soon switched almost entirely to beer after spending some time in Bavaria. Now Iâ€™ve realized that whenever I have just one glass of wine, it gives me stomachaches and gastrointestinal issues that last through the next day. At first, I thought maybe it was an alcohol thing, but I can drink two liters of beer without any problems.

Has anyone else experienced this? Could there be something specific in wine that causes these issues? Or is it possible that beer, with its anti-inflammatory compounds, helps counteract the effects of alcohol on my stomach?

Any insights would be appreciated!

This little wine is a lot tougher to find than you'd think, being the first time I have seen it in good quantity ever.  A lot to like here if you like the Pataille style of winemaking: very hands off, very transparent.

A charming wine the leaves you very happy sip after sip, after sniff. Gorgeous lift and ethereal aromatics (med+), red, sappy and high toned fruits coalesce with spice and minerality from the terroir for a great stem to glass representation.  The palate is medium bodied with med+ flavor density.  Med+ fresh finish.  Really great into to what the Pataille wines are like. Decant for 2 hours."

Question re: negociant bottlings,2,1g8odm9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1g8odm9/question_re_negociant_bottlings/,14,2024-10-21 19:23:27,"Recently I had a Domaine Meo-Camuzet Pommard 2019 and it blew me away. Incredibly balanced with floral, sappy fruit, well-integrated oak and undergrowth. I thought it was amazing. On closer inspection of the bottle, I noticed that ""Frere & Soeurs"" was printed beneath the domaine name. Is this a negociant bottling? Is the fruit from the domaine or negociant, and is there any difference in quality between the two? I'm fairly new to Burgundy so would appreciate some insight on this. Thanks in advance!"

Stefano Amerighi syrah 2021,17,1g7gxud,https://i.redd.it/csplpjwtnrvd1.jpeg,24,2024-10-20 02:42:42,"I hear a lot of people saying this is the best syrah outside France, so i thought i could get some shit making a post about it.

Premises: 
-I'm not a syrah connoisseur so i'm not compairing this with other wines but i'll refer to basic stuff i know about this variety, so feel free to correct me.

-I decanted it because it felt extremely closed after i tasted it and i didn't have time to see how long would have taked to open leaving it by itself. (Explanation for the non americans that don't decant every liquid contained in a glass bottle /s)

Since i pass by cortona very often for work, i went to this lovely winery to grab a couple of bottles.
They finished E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G. They've got nothing till next April. They kindly redirected me to a nice local grocery shop that had some. Lucky me

The winery is byodinamic and they say in the back label they press the grapes with feets. (Yummy)

Sooo, great color, deep dark ruby with violet shades, nonetheless, it leaves light pass through its body even enancing the brightness, when put under a lamp.
Less viscous than i would expect.

While smelling the cork i've got a strong hint of licorice that wasn't so dominant after.
In the glass the wine wasn't particularly intense, i could't properly discern many of the aromas exeption made for obvious violets, maybe some red roses, blackberries, ripe plums, sour cherries under spirit and the weakened hint of licorice.

In the mouth it felt very unbalanced, a strong acidity covered most of the wine's body. Alcol, low viscosity and sweetness weren't balancing the hardness of the wine.

I decanted it for about an hour, during this hour i sampled it and i might have smelled something a bit off one time. No trace of that after pouring at the end of decantation.

Now the nose was good: hint of tobacco added to the width of the wine, some fruit switched a bit on the jammy side and the sour cherry lost the alcoholic tone that was a bit too penetrative on the first try.

Mouth got the best out of it. Obviousely the acidity lowered and left space to some of the best tannins i've ever felt: smooth, silky and well integrated, i almost wanted to have more of em.
At this point the alcol was doing his job, supporting the sharp oriented body of the wine, so the low viscosity could leave you drink this well bodied wine like an easy pinot noir. Majestic job from the winemaker.
Finish was long enough, not something out of the world

The empty glass left a lovely, proustian for me, blackberry jam scent.

Few sediments were left on the bottom of the decanter.

I paired it with polish veil steak, dry-aged for 35 days and my 2 days old olive oil.
I was scared the dry-aging might have made the meat a bit too hematic and intense for the wine but it worked like a charm. The body of the wine integrated with the strong meat flavor and the acidity cleaned the greasiness of the fat and the oil, leaving the soft tannins and the animal flavor for long on the tongue.

30â‚¬   great, great wine. 95-96 points (93-94 imho) only took away points for complexity, equilibrium and intensity.
I didn't consider the sediments since they weren't it the tasted glass and gave max points for visual look. Maximum points for quality on both nose and mouth even if i'm not conviced about that. I think suckling gave it 98pt (wtf)


Ok, but why i didn't like it enough?

-In the end the acidity lowered but was still a bit too much, you could taste the greatness of the wine but idk, you had to kinda look at it through a window(?).
It needs few more years on his back, i hope the rest of the body won't lose anything

-I read about people saying this wine has great complexity. That's not what i call ""great complexity"".
1 flower and a half, 3 dark fruits and licorice is not complex, is the average note of a rich newbie tasting Petrus.
What are you gonna call a wine with 10 well defined deacriptors and hints of tar, vinyl and leather?
Even konstantin baum sais it has some flowers, blackberries, plum and pepper (that i don't actually percieve here and he explains why that's pretty common) and then proceeds to sing the praises of the great complexity of this wine. Am i missing something or that's just as wrong as it seems to me?

-I admit it just isn't my genre of wine lol.

What a stunning wine. This taste way more expensive than a Bourgogne should/could taste. Opened last night and continue to drink today.

Smell of red berries not as light as strawberry more like cherry and leather very approachable from such a young age.

Taste of spice and a cherry and acidic of a very fresh minerality, reminded me of why I love pinot. After 3 recent bottles of Bourgogne rouge I have drank in the past 2 months(not posted here because it didnt really impressed me as much). This is great.

From my experience, I have had way too many Bourgogne rouge that is just too breathless from being way too young. I think Bourgogne rouge should be approachable from release. Why would I have to wait for it if I also have to wait on village, premier cru and GC."
Gewurtz Going The Distance: 2009 Barmes-Buecher Gewurtztraminer Rosenberg ,24,1g7btvg,https://i.redd.it/dovnwj79iqvd1.jpeg,7,2024-10-19 22:49:31,"This is my first post about a specific wine on here so take it easy on me as I try to work on my tasting notes. 

I've been a growing fan of aromatic white wines with Alsace being chief among my go-to regions. I recently returned from my second stay in the area last month and decided to seek out some interesting wines back here state-side. 

I've not had the opportunity to visit Domaines Barmes-Buecher in my travels to Alsace, but it is definitely on my short list for a potential third trip. This particular bottling comes from the hills to the south-west of Wettolsheim, which is just west of Colmar. I absolutely love the older style label, it reflects much of the character of the region, even of it is a little marketing unfriendly. 

Onto what ended up in the glass: PnP initially and let it develop in the open bottle over the course of the evening. Deep gold/amber color, floral, honey and dried peach aromas. Flavors of honeysuckle, candied walnuts, dried peach, apricot and lychee. Medium long finish with some herbal spice and lasting sweetness. 

I had some initial concern about the age of this bottle vis-a-vis it's lieu-dit status. While a Grand Cru Gewurz could easily go for this kind of age, (or Trimbach's Seigneurs de Ribeaupierre) I wasn't sure about this producer's style, the individual terroir, or how much RS was there to help this expression along. This ended up being a treat, and I'm further convinced of the underrated ability of Gewurztraminer to age, at least when it is of the opulent Alsace style. "

"2001 Sassicaia and spicy Indian food, what a pairing! ",150,1g6zskj,https://i.redd.it/qykgbwseqmvd1.png,35,2024-10-19 10:08:04,"Drank from a 375ml bottle. 

I'm a huge fan of half bottles, they let you enjoy a glass of nice wine without committing to an entire bottle. Perfect for a glass at home before going out for the night.

Stood up for a few hours before opening. Needed a Durand to open, there was some discoloration on top of the cork. Thankfully, cork didn't crumble and bottle was totally fine, no cork taint, no brett.

First sip was actually ready to drink right away, tannins weren't harsh at all. But decided to slow ox for an hour before drinking, then drank over the next hour.

Over time, developed notes of dark plum, blackberry, dark cherry, rosemary. On the palate, medium acidity and nice long finish. Tannins definitely mellowed out with age. 

Shockingly, this paired very well with spicy pongal (a South Indian rice and lentil based dish). Another reminder that Indian food can pair really well with the right red wine, even though restaurants continue to insist on sparkling and semi-dry whites as the right pairing. 

I'd say this is squarely in the drinking window. I think there are years ahead on this, but I don't expect it to get better with time. 

I have one more half bottle left and intend to enjoy it in the same manner within the next two years.

Iâ€™m planning a 3-day trip to Healdsburg, CA, and would love your recommendations for wineries and restaurants in the area. The main reason for my visit is to dine at SingleThread, but Iâ€™m also looking to explore the fantastic wine scene and other great dining spots while Iâ€™m there.

Specifically, Iâ€™m interested in:

Wineries within a 30-minute drive of Healdsburg that focus on Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. Iâ€™d love to visit a mix of both premium and boutique (smaller, family-run) wineries.

Restaurant recommendations beyond SingleThread that highlight the best of the region's cuisine. Whether itâ€™s a cozy spot for breakfast, a great lunch spot, or an unforgettable dinner experience, Iâ€™m open to suggestions!


I appreciate any insights or must-visit places you can share. Thanks in advance!"

Help needed! Recognisable wines to be featured in movie?,0,1g7bjam,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1g7bjam/help_needed_recognisable_wines_to_be_featured_in/,20,2024-10-19 22:36:01,"Who are some â€œrecognisableâ€ producers?

Perhaps a slightly wacky question, but I need you, Reddit hive mind!

This is for a movie project Iâ€™m working on. The movie deals with generational divides and similarities at large, which is illustrated through various avenues, one of which being food and wine.

There are two subplot characters who get in a whole thing walking through different wine stores/looking at wine lists (probably the former but possibly the latter), with the younger character being super into natural wine and the older character being into (everyday) classics. For the natural wines I have a list already, including bottles like some Pheasantâ€™s Tears from Georgia, Bonhommeâ€™s Telquel, Meinklang Weisser Mulatschak, Gabrio Bini, Tissot, Matassa, EnvÃ­nate,â€¦

My question is: what are the equivalent producers in conventional winemaking? So not Barefoot, La Vieille Ferme, 19 Crimes, or Yellowtail, but what are some labels that the audience would recognise both visually and as good, solid (maybe even outstanding) bottles?

The AligotÃ© La Charme Aux PrÃªtres 2019 is ready and floral, with its aromas of citrus, grapefruit, white pepper, and a very light note of vanilla. The oak is expertly managed by Sylvain Pataille, who proves to be a great winemaker. On the palate, there's a distinct minerality that pairs well with a nice salinity. The finish is very long.
A great white wine, after all, it comes from one of the best crus of the appellation.

The Maranges 1er Cru La FussiÃ¨re 2020 is exceptional. In my opinion, the Domaine is among the best in the appellation. It can already be drunk now. On the nose, it's elegant with notes of wild strawberries and cherries, followed by a sensation of pomegranate, then flowers along with a clear balsamic note and mint. On the palate, it's smooth with its small silky tannins. The precise fruit melds with iodine notes and an elegant minerality. Long finish.

Colchagua Valley Cruisin',125,1g64iob,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g64iob,25,2024-10-18 06:30:21,"I've spent the last two days driving around Colchagua Valley in Chile and wanted to share some of my experience. I did some hurried research before this trip, but based on what I saw on this sub, there's room for more info to be put out there for the benefit of anyone thinking about a tour.

First, some logistics: Colchagua Valley is about a 2:30hr drive from Santiago Airport. Renting a car and making the drive is pretty easy - drive on the right like in the States, tolls are almost all taken care of electronically (like EZPass/SunPass) and are included in the rental price. Have some cash in case you find a booth that requires it. Be careful of surprise school zones with accompanying speed humps in the middle of a 70kph road.

There are a few towns that serve as anchor points in the valley. I stayed at a lovely hotel outside of Santa Cruz, Hotel Noi Blend. Super quiet in the middle of the vineyard fields, but not part of a winery. 

If you look at a map, you'll see a crescent-shaped mountain range just northeast of Santa Cruz. I basically did a lap around that. The landscape is beautiful with the Andes in the distance, and it's generally a fun drive.

I hit two wineries because I arrived in the afternoon Day 1, and Day 2 was kind of a trek. I booked in advance with Clos de Apalta (sister label of Lapostolle, actually their premium label), and ViÃ±a Vik. Both times, it was just myself and my wife on the English speaking tour. This seems to be an area more frequented by Latin American tourists. I would HIGHLY recommend knowing some Spanish, because almost no one speaks English outside of Santiago. I'm not saying that as a demonstration of anglophone privilege, it's just a fact this far away from the English-speaking world.

Winery impressions: Clos de Apalta was beautiful. They clearly care a lot about their process. Instead of steel tanks for fermentation, they use MASSIVE 7,500 liter oak barrels that they change every few years. Annual production is 20k cases. Lapostolle uses steel and cranks out 120k. The 7-story gravity system is some pretty remarkable engineering and really worth seeing. They also claim to have the oldest Carmanere vines in the region dating back to 1907.

ViÃ±a Vik has a bit more of a haughty air. Steel tanks everywhere but under a very impressive building. They import precut French oak to build their own barrels, which they then smoke with Chilean oak for a more subtle flavor. It was a cool process to see, but not quite the ""ooh-aah"" that I got with Clos. Their restaurant was very fine dining with a prix fix menu at $75pp, which includes two glasses of wine.

Wine impressions: I found out that I really like Carmenere! It's a brighter grape on the tongue but has lots of depth to it. I'm not an oenephile but I do have something of a palette, so I'll try my best here. Clos Apalta had three wines that we tried. Le Petit Clos 2020 was fun, everyday drinkable. It's the ""little brother"" of their major eponymous wine. Clos Apalta 2020 and 2012 were next. Even the guide agreed that the 2020 needed more time to mature. The 2012 was definitely a FULL expression of Carmenere, almost too much. Overall, we thought they were all delicious but would've aged the 2020 more.

ViÃ±a Vik had us try straight-from-the-barrel pours of Cab Sav and Carmenere to get a handle on the grape. Then we tried Milla Cala (our favorite), Vik the namesake, and La Piu Belle. Milla Cala was again, fun and drinkable. Not something you have to sit there and ponder over, but something to be enjoyed in the moment. I hope that makes sense. Vik was heavy and required time to chew on. Crazy long finish. Piu Belle was nice, but we tried their rosÃ© during dinner and that was SO much better. Overall, I think ViÃ±a Vik won the tasting contest.

Anyways, I hope this helps anyone looking to head out that way. It certainly opened my eyes to the better possibilities of Chilean wines. And there were TONS more wineries to explore, so I'll have to come back. Cheers!"

Can minerality come from unwashed grapes?,10,1g6h6i2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1g6h6i2/can_minerality_come_from_unwashed_grapes/,59,2024-10-18 19:45:12,"Hey guys!

I'm new to studying wine (I've done WSET Level 2 and CMS intro and I'm currently studying for both WSET 3 and CMS certified). I keep getting hung up on the concept of minerality. I know minerality in wine is a highly contested topic, the main argument being that grapes will not absorb the flavors of the soil they are grown in simply by being grown in them. Of course, this argument makes sense, but I'm having difficulty accepting that there is absolutely no correlation, given how certain wines do have minerality which can be percepted (even being able to differentiate between salinity, wet rock, limestone, flint, etc). 

After realizing most grapes aren't washed before fermentation, the logical conclusion that keeps coming into my brain is that the flavors are imparted from the organic matter left on the skins of the grapes.  I mean, if I dunk anything in salt water and then eat it, it should have a hint of saltiness, right? If I seasoned a piece of meat and left it to marinate for a few days, even if I rinsed it off before I cooked it, there should definitely be a lingering presence of the seasonings, no? I feel like this is definitely an over simplification that should have been mentioned and disproved by now, but I'm having trouble finding anything that talks about the difference washing grapes can make on flavor- everything I find focuses on native yeast and the effects on spontaneous fermentation. Please let me know if there are any materials (lectures, books, etc) that mention this/if I'm going crazy

Thanks!"

We opened one with the birth of each child and it became a mini tradition. Now we are having our fourth (and hopefully final haha) child and I wanted another bottle to continue the tradition. I was very tempted to go crazy and buy something like a Krug GC 171 but it's very hard to justify when I probably wouldn't appreciate it.

So I want a decent Â£50-100 bottle of 'celebration' wine and came across Eric Rodez wines while searching for options and they sound nice. 

The problem is that there are loads of choices (sweetness levels, BbB, BbN etc) and I have no real experience of selecting champagne. I generally prefer complex red wine but my wife prefers sweeter white if that helps (yes we are opposites). What bottle should I pick?"

The entire Dutch side is coming over and everybody expects me to handle the wine. I thought it would be nice to try some American wines over there as they are a bit overpriced and also rare on this side of the pond. That's why I was hoping people could give me some recommendations, preferably available for shipping to Florida. I am not a fan of topheavy overripe raisinny or oxidative wines, US wines I have tried and loved are Sandhi and Evening land(Raj Parr fan I guess). So slightly reductive, fresher and more nuanced/elegant styles I guess. Your recommendations would really mean a lot to me as US wine really is a bit of a blind spot and people on this subreddit seem so incredibly knowledgeable about them! I put the categories I'm looking for and some ideas I have had below. 60$ is not a hard limit but if I can keep the average around 50 a bottle I would be very happy.

(Edit: I find US wines to be a bit overpriced in the Netherlands specifically, there are many markets where they are great value and even some offer exceptional value in my country, just to be clear I am not a hater.)

Categories I'm looking for(and wines I am thinking of):

Sparkling: No clue :( I like a lot of lees and blanc de noir is generally a plus

Light white: No clue :( Big fan of Saumur Chenin, Silex Sancerre, Timorasso, Aligote or basically everything. Have not often liked new world Sauvignon Blanc though, tends to be a bit fruit heavy. Family doesnt like Riesling which is sad. Really not too aware of American whites outside of Chard and SauvB so anything cool/niche that comes to mind would be great!

Big white: Sandhi Santa Rita Hills Chardonnay(have not tried other bottlings), Bodega Chacra Mainque(found a good price am open to US equivalents)

Light Red: Evening Land Eloa Amity Hills Seven Springs Pinot Noir

Big Red: No clue :( I specifically do not want Cabernet or Merlot, was thinking some Syrah or GSM blends would be cool any other recommendations also more than welcome! Something structured with vibrant fruit and good balance would be appreciated :) Edit: Am really interested in varietal Syrah bottlings actually, any good producers? Looking at Mark Ryan wild eyes and L'ecole no 41 estate syrah right now, but I do not know the producers.

Dessert wine always a bonus :P (Edit: Riesling would be fine in a dessert wine, apologies for being unclear)

Wine Cooler/Fridge Advice Needed for Unconventional Reason!,1,1g62w3h,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1g62w3h/wine_coolerfridge_advice_needed_for/,2,2024-10-18 05:11:46,"Greetings fellow oenophiles!

Sadly, when I moved out of my last home nearly 2 years ago, we were unable to lug our ancient beast of a 300-400 bottle wine storage vault up the stairs of our 115 yr-old home and therefore had to include it as a ""feature"" of the sale (it worked btw!). We also had to drain my collection of fine wines prior to and after the sale since we didn't have a great place to store them in our ""new"" 110 yr-old home that we are now doing a full gut reno on. It was truly a VERY painful endeavor.  :)  My liver is still recovering, ha!

Anyway, here's an unusual question for you: I need a temperature and humidity-controlled space in which to store my dahlia tubers over the winter after I dig them out of the ground. A **single-zone** wine fridge/cooler with roughly a minimum of 36-48 bottle capacity (but bigger is always better), preferably less than $1000 US, and A STABLE TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY unit is what I need (temps in the 40s-50 F). I don't care if it's damn ugly, free-standing, etc., as it will be in my basement and have a temperature and humidity monitor in it. I cannot over-emphasize how important the stability of the temperature and humidity are. I have thousands of dollars invested in these tubers (not to mention all of the love and sweat equity that goes with gardening), so I cannot afford to lose them. 

As a trial, I bought one on Amazon during Prime Days last week for about $300 (by Antarctic) and have been monitoring the temps/humidity daily based on different temp settings ranging from 42-50 F. It has frankly been very disturbing. The photo shows the 3 monitors I had placed in it when I set the wine fridge at 43 F. (Note: I put the 2nd digital monitor and regular thermometer in 2 days later in order to ensure that the original digital monitor was accurate.) Bottom line: this unit is a piece of sh\*t due to the wild variations, and I didn't even mention the condensation on the inside. I will try to initiate a return to Amazon. Sigh...

Based on this, can you please provide me with your recommendations? I've been looking at TONS of reviews on-line in every place imaginable, but there doesn't appear to be a consensus. Again, I need a single-zone unit. Do you have any knowledge about the Cosmo 24"" 48-bottle unit (approx. $880 US)? It seems to get good reviews, but I'm doubtful of everything at this point. I'll take any and all recommendations, as I have to begin my harvest soon!

PS I don't want to buy a used unit on FB Marketplace, Craigslist, etc., as I don't want to take any further chances with reliability, etc.

Many thanks!"

So we are trying to decipher when a bottle of champagne we have might have been produced. So hoping there might be some people here who can help.

Backstory - itâ€™s part of a collection we manage and the story is the guy who the collection is about (Bruce McLaren) won/podium at a race in Reims. As a reward he got a case of champagne.

Naturally over the years these things disappear. Most likely was enjoyed at a house party or two! However one was donated to the collection saying it was a bottle Bruce won at Reims.

However photos of him on the podium show a different style label on the neck.

Champagne 
Heidsieck & Co
Dry Monopole

Interesting notes to help decipher
- has a royal warrant from the Queen
- contents is in pint/ounces

I have a photo of Bruce celebrating with a bottle same brand different neck label. Circa 1962.

Hopefully some wine detectives here :)"

Ordered at Compagnie in NYC.

Initially, a bit of brett and lots of sediment, so decided to decant, which was the right decision.

Brett never fully faded, but the wine did open up nicely and showed from cherry and plum notes, more on the stewed side.

This is definitely past its prime, but still very enjoyable and a wonderful experience!

What's the funniest or supidest experience you've have while drinking wine or opening a bottle?,27,1g4hddg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1g4hddg/whats_the_funniest_or_supidest_experience_youve/,12,2024-10-16 03:21:06,"List them! My personal faves:

1. My friend and her mom were visiting me, was their last night in Paris so we decided to open a bottle of wine and enjoy the view of the Eiffel tower. But we forgot a corkscrew, all the shops were closed, and for some reason nobody we asked had one. So we decided to come up with a plan, I would hold the bottle and jam a stick into the cork, and my friend would step on it. I did it before. Well, this time the bottle instantly exploded and lacerated my hand pretty badly, so the romantic sunset was cut short because we had to go wash my bloody and and arm off. Also because it was an air b' n b, there was nothing in the apartment so I just wrapped it in toilet paper.

2. Using 'the Breton method' to open a bottle of wine...once again, no bottle opener. So you take a shoe, put the bottle in it, and tap or bang it against a concrete wall. Worked like a charm and the night was saved! 

3. I was drinking some champagne with two or three friends in CafÃ© Oz. The bartenders started spraying champagne into the bar for a bit of entertainment, which is fun, but they accidentally sprayed my friend right in the face and her hair was soaked haha. She was not happy about that, but it was still funny. Then a few minutes later some crazy Australians threw like two beer bottles and they exploded on the wall right above us.

4. A friend's younger brother wanted to open a wine bottle, I said no, let me do it. He insisted. The cork flew up right in his face (literally flinging his hair on his forehead up) then bounced around everywhere. He dad also opened a bottle of wine/champagne with a sabre-like knife a few times, which was pretty cool."

- Century tour & library tasting: covers current releases & older vintage counterparts  
- â€œMonte Belloâ€ cab tasting: which seems to focus on wines specifically from the Monte Bello vineyard including current release M.B.

I'm at the very beginning of my wine journey and want to focus on learning the ""basic/classic"" grapes, which I'd think would be pinot gris, sauvignon blanc, chardonnay, pinot noir, and cab sauv.

* **(1) Would you add anything else to ""basics/classics?"" these?** Gamay? Cab Franc? Merlot?

I want to get a strong sense of what is typical for these grapes. Thus,

* **(2) How many wines should I (reasonably) drink of each grape?**

>-> Obviously if I had unlimited time and budget, I would drink as many as possible, but I also don't think these grapes will be my favorites (right now I like things like Moscato d'Asti, Albarino, and orange wines, to be honest). So I am thinking 3-5? But I'm also mostly working on this alone, so I will probably waste lots of these bottles, especially if I'm trying to do them simultaneously? **(Is there any way to buy tiny wines, like the half bottles, or maybe you'd recommend I just go to a wine bar and drink glasses, so I'd pay the same prices but not waste?)**

* **(3) Of the number of wines I'm targetting for each grape, would you recommend focusing on just one region?**

>-> For instance, I could just drink French for all of these grapes; or for something like Pino Gris, which seems majority Italian, I could exclusively drink Italian? I think I'm trying to get a ""pure"" comparison

* **(4) Or is the idea more to drink one typical cheap one of the grape, one typical expensive wine of the grape, and a few weird category-stretching ones** (e.g., make sure to taste a ""typical"" stainless steel chardonnay in addition typical oak-aged ones)?
* **(5) How can I predict in advance whether a given wine will teach me about typicality? I would love specific recommendations for three typical chardonnays, for instance. Or is this the kind of thing to just ask at a wine shop, rather than on Reddit?**

**Or am I thinking about all of this all wrong?**

That said, I know itâ€™s a common opinion that in a tasting you should keep the wines fairly similar and stick to one consistent theme. Personally, I like tasting a bunch of different things and I think it helps you figure out what you really like, but I can also understand the argument that you will only really understand a wine in the context of other similar wines. Thereâ€™s also the fact that the order of the wines matters, I donâ€™t want the Riesling to make the Chardonnay seem flabby or the Rioja to be too intense after the Chardonnay. Weâ€™ll be having food between though, so Iâ€™m not too worried, but stillâ€¦ Thoughts?"

Preferably one zone (but two if it has to be)

Have a compressor

Be stainless steel

Hold about 44 or more bottles

Easy to move shelves

And most importantly - be quiet and also hassle free and reliable.

Cost $1600 or less (preferably lessâ€¦..)

  
I am not a wine connoisseur - I drink wine because I like a glass of wine each day.  I am not cellaring wine - I pick up a supply at Total etc and then like to stock the fridge so that it is there and chilled ready to drink.  

I have a Costco membership and some sort of Best Buy membership.

To be even more clear, Iâ€™m not asking about the approach to tasting, I use the WSET systematic approach to tasting, which is one way to taste and gather information, Iâ€™m more interested in how you take notes during the tasting. I donâ€™t have the memory to just taste 6 wines and remember everything about them to jot down later.

Bucket list wine? - 05 d'Auvenay Macabrees,28,1gtg1cl,https://i.redd.it/kyo9kpoldh1e1.jpeg,8,2024-11-17 22:32:11,"2005 d'Auvenay Auxey-Duresses Macabree

Have always wanted to try Auvenay as some would say it's some of the best white wines in the world.

Caramel popcorn, struck matches, orange marmalade, white blossoms on the nose. The aromatics are insane.

On the palate, honey, a diffused citrus blend of lemons with oranges, some orange marmalade, a bit of cooked fruits, orange peel, crushed rocks, and a hint of baking spices. The honeyed mineral orange peel mix flows into the long finish, which glides down effortlessly. The finish balances out the honey caramel popcorn in the front of the palate so well that it keeps you reaching for the next sip. The wine feels decadent but light at the same time.

As it airs, more of that honeyed marmalade sensation comes out. 

One thing that I feel like it's missing is a bit of fruit and fruit intensity, but that might be because of the terroir. Nevertheless, amazing winemaking."

I didnâ€™t see a recent post about hills to die on so, why not start a new one. Hereâ€™s mine. Please let me know if you agree or not.

The wine hill I will die on is that blends are not more â€˜sophisticatedâ€™ or â€˜nuancedâ€™ or â€˜complexâ€™ than monocÃ©pages. I have heard this from both experienced and novice drinkers. My rationalization is that wines contain dozens of chemical compounds that determine taste and mouthfeel (can you taste colour?). (Chemically even hundreds, but most are trace amounts.) Does it really matter if you have 50 chemical compounds in a wine or 100? I would say no. Does â€˜valueâ€™ (I know, prices can be absurd, but letâ€™s assume wines can be valued more or less objectively) have anything to say here? And since many of the most valuable wines are monocÃ©pages (DRC to name just the most obvious), they are clearly not valued less than blends. Or is there another quality that determines prices for monocÃ©pages (besides obvious ones such as limited supply for top sellers such as DRC)?"

Splurge Review! 2006 Cheval Des Andes,23,1gt46gp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gt46gp,4,2024-11-17 10:03:44,"A few weeks back, I asked this sub which wine at my shop I should splurge on. The two wines that were most recommended were a 2018 Isole et Olena Ceparello and a 2016 Beaucastel CdP. While both of those wines look amazing and fall within my desired price range, I wanted a wine that would be a bit more approachable for the people I intended to share it with, meaning something with a little more age that required less decanting and didnâ€™t need to be paired with a meal to be truly appreciated. This 2006 Cheval Des Andes fit the bill perfectly, not to mention it was personally recommended by people whose opinions I trust.

""Cheval des Andes is the result of the union between ChÃ¢teau Cheval Blanc, Premier Grand Cru ClassÃ© â€œAâ€ of Saint Emilion, Bordeaux and Terrazas de los Andes, a pioneer of cool-climate, high-altitude winemaking in Argentina. Distinguished by its freshness, elegance and exceptional ageing potential, the wine of Cheval des Andes is the Grand Cru of the Andes.â€

Notes:

Such complexity right out of the bottle. Aromas of green peppercorn, dried leaves, tobacco, vanilla, roasted nuts, and dates. Itâ€™s all knit together around core of blackberry, but itâ€™s subtle, there in the background. 

With about an hour in the glass, the nose comes across warmer and and much more integrated. Iâ€™m getting tobacco, vanilla, hazelnuts, dates, cherry, and star anise. Really lovely. 

An hour and a half later, a lot of the same, but a thereâ€™s a distinct note of rich cocoa.

The palate is well-balanced, delicious, but a bit less expressive than the nose. As youâ€™d expect for a wine of this age, the acidity and tannins have mellowed, but for my taste, itâ€™s lacking structure. I was hoping for a little more power and a little more grip, just enough to give this wine a longer-lasting finish. That being said, itâ€™s still tasty and perfectly enjoyable, and at $70, I feel itâ€™s money well spent. Right out of the bottle, Iâ€™m getting notes of tobacco, blackberry, dried red fruit, licorice, and cloves. The fruit comes back to life the more this wine breathes. 

Verdict:

Loved it. Not perfect, but truly enjoyable, and so fun to share with good company. 93 points.

In the picture below you can see that the wooden piece is keeping the metal shelf support from being able to ""slot in"". Can anyone with this fridge let me know if I'm missing something or if theirs looks different?

American Headaches,0,1gswuf7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gswuf7/american_headaches/,11,2024-11-17 03:58:36,"To parafrase the famous qoute: I do wine like a champion. I appreciate a great bottle, vallue the experience of sharing in good company but am also happy to lower my pretentiousness and have a great night with a lot of good, affordable red. Why do I think I am I good at it? No headaches, hangovers, reason to doubt my choices of the night before - regardless of abundance and quality. Typically I go for  Italian and Austrian wines...

I travel to the US Frequently. All is different there. Contrary to popular notion, I think american wine tends to be extremely tastefull and creative. A flavourful Zinfandel is a great drink. However, it ruins my trips. After three glasses (or two bottles allike), it punishes me the next day. Relentlessly! Every single time.

How is this possible and most importantly, what to look for. I assume its the sulfites. But even 'no sulfite added' and biological wines are no guarantee. I am over there for xmas and would highly appreciate your input and suggestions to make good choices this time."

What bottles of wine would you recommend to someone who isnâ€™t a wine person but wants to get into it? ,11,1gswjgv,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gswjgv/what_bottles_of_wine_would_you_recommend_to/,30,2024-11-17 03:44:04,"The person in this case being me.

I really only drink beer (mostly seasonal stuff) and hard liquor (mostly whiskey, bourbon, tequila) but there are some nights where I feel it would be nice to crack open a bottle of wine and enjoy it with dinner (something I think I literally have never done). I made a nice ribeye steak dinner last night and had a guest over and I thought to myself I wish I could have brought out a nice bottle of something to go with it.

The only wine I drink sometimes is when my wife gets Wolffer Estate Summer in a Bottle (a rosÃ©).

If you could recommend 1 bottle of each - red, white, rosÃ© - which would you recommend?

Preferably something not too hard to find and nothing too pricey (maybe $50 to $100 max).

I am not just asking for dinner wines so feel free to recommend anything!

This has aged so gracefully and really is strutting itâ€™s stuff, a kaleidoscope of flavors ranging from fresh fruit to sherry (in the best way possible) this is drinking at peak form and will continue to drink nicely for atleast a few more years. 

The biggest surprise was the 88â€™ Belle Ã‰poque rose, this was oxidative but the acidity maintained its freshness, wilted rose petal, autumn leaves, blood orange, burnt sugar. This to me showed more character and I found it to be more charming than the VC. While the VC was in peak form I just found the BE so interesting. 

I love mature bordeaux, burgundy in all forms, Old German riesling, etc. however vintage champagne has cemented a spot in my heart that my wallet is very upset about. "
"1973 Chateau Lascombes, Margaux ",44,1gstnxi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gstnxi,5,2024-11-17 01:32:21,"I have notes! First off, what a TREAT to open this 1973 vintage with my close friends! Chateau Lascombes is one of five 2nd growths in Margaux and is a mile west of Chateau Margaux. 1973 was a wet and hot season with a large, underripe crop. From what I understand, this is still a Cabernet weighted blend, bottled before Lascombes switched to Merlot based blends for their more modern vintages. 

On the nose sharp cherry jumps out at you with menthol and hint of olive. The palate starts with light, underripe tart cherry with some notes of pomegranate and dates. Quickly turns predominantly earthy though with heavy olive, tea leaves, tobacco, dried Italian herbs, bit of leather, and some mint on the finish. It is medium bodied at this point with medium plus acidity and low-medium tannins that are velvety at best. Such a smooth, earthy finish that lingers. It is past its peak for sureâ€¦but pleasantly surprised how it has held up. Would definitely drink now! 91 points. "

My question - I assume there are additives for both color and the back end sweetness? What are they, and why? And for California wines in general, is there any way to identify whether the wine has additives vs a true expression of the grape/terroir?

Slightly inky as well, I think that's the 15% Malbec showing.

Paired well with spicy Vijaywada Paneer Biryani (anyone who says Indian food can't go with red wines can leave now).

Solid Cabernet on a budget, would recommend to anyone wanting a fruity Napa Cab without breaking the bank.

75% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Malbec, 7% Cabernet Franc, 3% Petit Verdot.

My shop is considering bringing it in, so no price on it yet, but it will probably be somewhere in the $40-60 range. 

Notes:

Straight out of the bottle, the nose is pretty savory and rustic, showing off a bright core of raspberry, cherry and vanilla. Within 30 minutes, these aromas mellow out into a lovely bouquet of black currant, cherry, dark chocolate, chili pepper and peppercorn. Thereâ€™s a subtle floral element here too, but itâ€™s tough to identify. 

On the palate, notes of red cherry, strawberry, red bell pepper, and a touch of black pepper. Bright acidity is balanced against very fine tannins. This is a light and lively wine, but it still comes across as well-extracted, and the finish is long-lasting. Iâ€™m not experienced at scoring wines, but Iâ€™d give this lovely Austrian blend 92 points."

Owned by the Fayat family, La Dominique sits right next to Cheval Blanc, but the composition is different due to the soil being more clay based. 14 months in 60% new and 40% used oak. From 2017 onwards the estate has started using polymer and glass amphoras to age part of the wine to maintain freshness. I visited the estate this summer and its beautiful!

45min of air before assessing. 
Color: Deep dark red with garnet rim.
Nose: Very complex with dark fruits and spice. Lingonberry, ripe cassis, blackberry, blueberry , cedar. At this point in its development there is light cinnamon bread notes such as cinnamon, clove and nutmeg. Just a hint of funk / garrigue in the background.

Taste: Wine is open, medium+ / full bodied, polished and smooth. Tannins are still quite present, but showing first signs of being resolved. The dark fruited taste follows the nose. Very complex and long. Still developing as it gets air in the glass.

Long life ahead of this wine, but its showing beautifully open right now. 

Rest of the wine will tomorrow be paired with duck breast, carrot puree , roasted garlic chips and blackberry & raspberry reduction. "

**Project Topic**  
Our project explores the drinking habits of younger generations, focusing on alcoholic beverages and their alternatives. For some time we've seen a decline in wine consumption among people aged 20â€“30 compared to previous generations at the same age. To better understand why this shift is happening, weâ€™ve put together a quick 5-minute anonymous survey.

**Goal**  
Our goal is to uncover the reasons behind this trend and find ways to inspire younger generations to choose wine as their preferred drink once again. To achieve this, we would greatly appreciate it if you could take a few minutes to complete our survey.

Iâ€™m automatically thinking Riesling will be the star of the show, and I can do a comparison of dry to off-dry or sweet/late harvest. I also want to have at least one sparkling, because damn the finger lakes are popping off with sparklers the last decade or so. I know nothing about reds in the area (other than Dr. Frank seperavi) but people will expect at least one. Gewurztraminer also seems like it could be fun to include, as an iconic grape of the region that not as many people are familiar with.

Thought it was pretty funny. Some clueless glaikit tried out Buckfast,129,1grrsyu,https://i.redd.it/rs4dom4bz01e1.jpeg,33,2024-11-15 15:23:33,"An American wine connoisseur made the mistake of reviewing buckfast. Tasting notes:

Buckfast Tonic Wine (No Vintage)

Screw cap, took it off about 30 minutes before to bring in some air. Apparently made by monks in England. Decided to try while cooking dinner. Poured into a glass, first glance has a very inky almost brownish color that you see in older wines. Very syrupy, liquid clings to the side of the glass when swirled. Almost 15% ABV.

Stuck my nose in and was hit with something I've never experienced before. Barnyardy funk (in a bad way) almost like a dead animal in a bird's nest. A mix of flat Coca Cola and caramel with a whiff of gun metal.

On the palate, overwhelming sweetness and sugar. Cherry Cola mixed with Benadryl. Unlike anything I've tasted. I'm not sure what this liquid is but it is not wine, I'm actually not sure what it is but it tastes like something a doctor would prescribe. A chemical concoction of the highest degree. Can only compare it to a Four Loko.

Managed to make it through a couple small glasses but not much more. Has absolutely ruined the evening drinking-wise for me as I tried to drink a nice Bordeaux after but the iron-like metallic sweet aftertaste I just couldn't get out of my mouth even after a few glasses of water. I don't drink a lot of coffee regularly so I also have mild heart palpitations from the caffeine after just drinking a bit of this and feel a slight migraine.

An ungodly concoction made by seemingly godly men. I believe the Vatican needs to send an exorcist over to Buckfast Abbey as the devil's works are cleary present there. After tasting this ""wine,"" the way I feel can only be described as akin to being under a bridge on one's knees orally pleasing a vagrant while simultaneously drinking liquified meth through a dirty rag.

I've drank a lot of wines in my life and will never forget this one."

My friend enjoys red wine and from what I know, prefers:

* medium bodied wines (but doesn't mind full bodied wines over dinner)
* isn't overly sweet or dry (though I do suspect they like drier wines?) 
* has some complexity -- not sure what that means, does that mean some tannins? 

When we go out drinking and we have wine, my friend has mentioned enjoying really smooth red wines during their dinners? I'd ideally like to buy a red wine bottle that hopefully they would enjoy and priced around $75 to $150. I'm in NYC so if there's any shops you could recommend and what to look for or even ask the staffs/somms that would be amazing too! "

Tasted over the course of 3 days. 

Eye: radiant gold. 

Nose: intense burnt caramel, orange peel, marzipan. 

Mouth: opulent in the extreme. Vibrant acidity, highly complex and incredibly dense, initially follows the nose, soon accompanied by white peach, honeysuckle, scuppernong. I can still taste the sip I took 5 minutes ago. 

Continued to blossom over the three days, and if anything was clearer and more intense on day 3. 

Magical wine. Absolutely magical. It tasted like late childhood summers growing up in the United States Deep South. I canâ€™t wait until the other two I bought have a bit of age. "

* Color: Dark, reddish purple
* Nose: Red fruits, raspberries, blackberries, no perceptible alcohol
* Palate: Medium to low body, feels light on the palate, a little bit of pleasant acidity, mostly purple and red fruits, blackberries, round tannins, and dried herbs (maybe thyme)
* ABV: 14.5%
* Price: $18
* Food pairings: Fettuccine with ragÃ¹ Bolognese (really nice), Detroit-style pepperoni pizza, mild Italian sausage and tomato pasta, spiced kebabs and tehina on rice (best pairing)
* Overall rating: 6/10 (very good, a cut above)
* Notes: Purchased at Costco, so I figured a quick review might help others. It's not entirely clear who makes this wine. Bottle says *bottled* by ""Vignobles & Compagnie"" (Suckling also has them as the producer), but I can't find this expression on their site. They do make a CdP with Grenache and Syrah.

Occasionally, it's fun to spend a bit more and try something of higher quality or more renowned. For these, I'm either doing some research ahead of time or talking to the somm in the store. 

As a new father, I thought it would be a fun treat to get a nice bottle when I finished my paternity leave from work. I'll also probably splurge each time my retirement account hits certain marks.

My question to those of you on a similar budget is, what are some other fun reasons to treat yourself to a nicer than average bottle?

Here is what I have planned but I have some time to change things up or add if needed: 

* Day 1: Traditional (southern leaning) Thanksgiving dinner 
   * 2009 Occidental Cuvee Elizabeth Pinot noir (2 bottles)
   * 2020 Hermann J Wiemer HJW Bio Riesling (2 bottles) 
* Day 2: Make your own pizza 
   * 2013 Dom (2 bottles) 
   * I'm debating getting a red here, maybe a Rosso di Montalcino. I don't know how many people will just drink beer or cocktails with their pizza 
* Day 3: Grill night-This night will be a smaller group as some will leave. We'll probably have more steak than chicken but a selection of meats on the grill 
   * For red-I have a 2004 La Rioja Alta 890 that I wanted to open this weekend and I think this might be the night. I also have a 2009 Beaucastel cdp and a few youngish big cabs that I would be willing to take 
   * For white-2022 Suertes del Marques Vidonia V.P., likely just one bottle but I have more if needed

I cancelled my subscription after the promotional rate (read poor), but I was wondering, can anyone tell me if there are other companies which offer such deals? Or, are there subscription wine companies that offer very inexpensive deals consistently? I was kinda hoping I could just ride a wave of promotions to sort of expose myself to a wide variety of red wines without breaking the bank."

Saying all wine tastes the same is like going to an art museum with very blurry eyes and saying all the art looks the same (A thought exercise),0,1gqwa56,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gqwa56/saying_all_wine_tastes_the_same_is_like_going_to/,5,2024-11-14 11:00:05,"Edit: This is not at all a snobbery thing, as I'm a total beginner in wine.  I just think it's an actually true analogy.

Has anyone else ever used this analogy?  If you went into a museum with blurry eyes, you'd say everything is basically the same.  Only statues and crazy weird colors would stand out.  But most would look similar.

The same is true in wine.  Anyone will taste major differences between wines, but in the broad section of ""paintings"" aka ""reds"", folks often get confused.  But the more you learn, the clearer you see, and the more you notice there's a world of subtle difference between wines.  And yet it's not objective, it's to be interpreted.  It's not objectively better or worse in a measurable way.

Do people like this analogy?"

In the mouth, it is finely powerful and virile, complex and with good acidity and well-integrated tannins. Beautifully balanced, its length in the mouth is notorious with impressive flavours of black fruits that persist on the palate.

\--

  
Very long overdue trip report. Thank you so much for all of the help from r/kelowna and r/wine! We stayed for a week, and targeted between 3-5 wineries per day. So many folks here helped us curate a list of places to visit, and we really appreciate you all.

Wineries we visited:

Cawston

* Crowsnest Vineyards
* Seven Stones Winery

Kelowna

* Priest Creek
* Quail's Gate
* Soma Craft Cidery
* Spearhead\*

Naramata

* Daydreamer\*
* Four Shadows
* Howling Bluff Estate Winery
* Kettle Valley
* Lang Vineyards
* Poplar Grove Winery

Okanagan Falls

* Meyer Family\*

Oliver & Osoyoos

* Bartier Brothers Vineyard & Winery
* Black Hills Estate Winery
* Culmina Family Estate Winery\*
* Fairview Cellars\*
* Phantom Creek

Summerland

* 8th Generation Vineyard
* Lightning Rock
* Solvero Wines\*

\*Highlights (very personal opinion though, we have something positive to say about all of them)

Overall, we had an amazing time. Summerland was the perfect spot for us to stay for the week, with easy access to wineries, trails, groceries, and the beach. I've marked our favourites above. Daydreamer, Fairview, and Meyer were particular highlights.

I feel that we got a good mix of different types of wineries, and have an extensive list of places we didn't get to go this time but would be very keen to visit.

Notable Wine and Tasting Notes

* There was no shortage of styles and varietals to try. We may have been biased in our winery selections. Typically it was cooler climate varietals, Burgundian, and it was rare to find blends.
* Lots of range in the varietals themselves. For example Syrah went from overwhelming black pepper, to barely any pepper if at all. The reluctant rose from Fairview stood out coming from a small planting of Syrah (which is sadly no longer there). The Syrah from Daydreamer, and bit less the Shiraz from the same location, was also great.
* After hearing about it, we asked for and we were allowed a free tasting of smoke tainted wine from Meyer which was quite the educational experience. Turns out you canâ€™t really taste or smell smoke from the juice. You can definitely taste and smell it after the wine has been made. Smelled like a newly painted room to me. Very obvious notes of some kind chemical on those nose but not at all pleasant in a way a Riesling would be. On the palette, the best way I could describe it would be if someone had infused the wine with tire smoke. To be clear, this was not representative of the wines from this winery in any way. They had some awesome chard and pinot.Â 
* Marechal Foch, a somewhat native hybrid grape, wasnâ€™t really our jam and tasted a bit like it too. It made for a surprisingly good port though at Lang Vineyards.
* Speaking of jam wines, there was also a fruit winery we literally stumbled into while looking for lunch at Sleeping Giant fruit winery. Tasted like what you would expect. Not a lot of nuance. All fruit forward, on the sweeter end but not too cloying. Apricot was probably our favourite. If Pie was a wine.
* Clos Du Soleil had some really nice Bordeaux blends. Very approachable, and easy to recommend to nearly anyone. Notably they also had their own take on a sauternes (called â€œSaturnâ€). No botrytis, but still a sweet wine with lots of complexity and a nice balance of acidity.
* For our palettes, we found the best QPR was from somewhat unsurprisingly, the smaller more quaint looking wineries. Not that we were shy from visiting the higher budget and bigger looking wineries.

Visiting Notes

* We had an â€œelevatedâ€ tour from Grape Escapes on the first day. It gave us a great initial impression of the range and variety. As we tasted it was also a great way to get suggestions to other wineries that might be more our style in both decor and palette.
* It cannot be stressed enough how many wineries there are. You could spend months trying wineries. If your visit is somewhat short you should try your best to choose carefully. The range in quality and styles can be quite large.
* The density of wineries in Naramata is certainly impressive, and we were very glad that we had a short list already ready. Suggestions from other wineries were always welcome.
* There is a wide range of wineries to choose from - some fancy, some down-to-earth, some in the middle. We were curious about the fancy ones like Quail's Gate and Phantom Creek, and were glad to visit. We enjoyed the more casual ones like Daydreamer and Fairview the most.
* Things were relatively quiet when we visited and it was likely due to a lack of harvest. Solvero Wines took us on an impromptu tour! Really lovely family-run place in a gorgeous setting.
* Fairview Cellars had a nice catalogue of back vintages and it was fun to try a bunch in succession, especially since the ownership has changed. Got to taste wines with 10 years apart between them.
* If we went back, we would want to visit Hidden Chapel. It is the new vineyard run by the previous winemaker from Fairview which was a big hit for us.
* Unfortunately the harsh conditions of the previous winter impacted the harvest, and it's been tough on many growers and workers. We saw many vineyards replanting, ripping out dead stock, etc. Weâ€™re curious how this will impact the region long term.
* We skipped Mirabel as they didn't have an appointment until relatively late in the day, and we were getting tired. But we ended up visiting a cidery (Soma Craft Cidery) which was much better than anticipated. And we got to feed alpacas, bonus!
* Everyone was absolutely lovely, and it felt very pleasant to be travelling to another part of Canada and still feel at home.
* Other than Quail's Gate, Blue Mountain, Mirabel, and Scout we had no trouble walking in for a tasting without calling ahead / scheduling. We aren't disappointed, as there were so many wonderful options but I think I'll coordinate the latter 3 on our next trip.
* The Spotted Lake down in Osoyoos was a very random stop. We turned the car around to go back and get a better look. If anyone goes to that area... I think it was worth a look."

Recent premox situation with Pierre Morey?,1,1gqej9p,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gqej9p/recent_premox_situation_with_pierre_morey/,11,2024-11-13 21:48:50,"Iâ€™ve had a few bottles of Pierre Morey (not PYCM) recently and all of them were equally, more advanced than expected. They were 2 bottles of Terre Blanches 2019 and a bottle of Les Tessons 2019, and they all come from a reputed importer in my country and two different retailers so itâ€™s unlikely this is a storage issue.

Is Pierre Morey known for premox issue in recent vintages? The bottles are sealed with natural cork so I guess thatâ€™s possible but I havenâ€™t heard too much premox complaints about the producer, and itâ€™s very odd to think 3 out of 3 bottles are premoxed. That said the wine was already getting gold and it has completely lost its flinty reductive characters and the wine felt kinda fat if not completely tired.

I had a bottle of Les Tessons 2019 just 2 years ago and the wine was pretty flinty and structured so itâ€™s hard for me to believe the wine changes this much just in 2 years. However Iâ€™m not experienced with white burgundy at this stage so maybe they were in their awkward phase. All the white burgundy I had before were either a little younger or much older. Someone with more experience with this producer or white burgundy in general, any thoughts?"

Iâ€™m 29 and recently got into collecting.
My local wine shop has a huge vintage section and itâ€™s in a low-income neighborhood so the deals are often ridiculous (for Canada/NA). Iâ€™ve read that Barolos and Barbarescos from 2019/2020 will be some of the best vintages and Iâ€™ve recently started collecting them when on sale. Admittedly these are some of the cheaper names in Barolo, but I have youth on my side. 

My question is: will almost all baroloâ€™s/barbarescoâ€™s from 2019/2020 appreciate by 2030 even if theyâ€™re from lesser names (but well reviewed) brands like: Fontanafreddo, Ellena Giuseppe, batasiolo, pertinance, enrico serrafino.

We live in a retirement community and are looking to have residents provide information along with a 5 or 6 wine tasting examples of whites to reds. 

We are not looking for an expensive experience. Wines we sample generally run the $20-40 range give or take. Mostly wines that can be purchased and enjoyed through our local wine supplier or larger consumer grocery. 

Examples of recent meetings was one focused on Lujon winery. Another was focused on some Eastern European wines from Croatia, Romania and Hungary as a group was traveling there. This summer we did one called Chillâ€™in and Grilliâ€™in, about reasonably priced wine to drink while enjoying summer entertaining. 

We do talk about foods that go with the wines from cheeses to spicy to meats to seafoods, etc. 

Any help you can provide, or if you point me to any other source for information would be greatly appreciated.

I would like to celebrate a nice anniversary I've got coming up with one of those two as they are above my usual price point. I know they are quite young but probably already very nice anyway (never tried a quality burgundy before, exciting moment) but don't have much experience with decanting and opening the bottles way before consumption. Which one would be a better choice to drink this early and how do I approach them (how long before to open before serving etc.) to get the best possible experience?"

This year I am going to be doing 2 whites and 2 reds. Same varietals with large price gaps  (I understand this is subjective, minimum is $30 USD).

Iâ€™m currently working towards WSET Level 3. I donâ€™t currently work in the industry but I could see myself doing it as a 2nd career or retirement job. I just love wine! 

My wife and I were discussing the semantics and connotation of â€˜sommelierâ€™ and whether one has to be a â€˜Certified Sommelierâ€™ in order to call themselves a Somm? Technically a Somm is just a wine steward. 

If/when I pass WSET level 3, Iâ€™d love to call myself a Somm, but I have some reservations: 1) I donâ€™t work in industry and 2) WSET doesnâ€™t focus on service. However, if I help others learn to love and appreciate wine, wouldnâ€™t that make me a steward?

I know I could always just pivot and take the CMS, but I honestly have no interest in the service aspect. I also recognize that at the end of the day itâ€™s a bit petty, but Iâ€™d still love your opinions. "

I want to carry some red wine to taste on my camping setup in the evening.

I wonder what your opinions are on the quality of the wine if I am to bring them in their respective manner.

1. pour a bottle into a soft bottle, plastic pet or flask. do this the morning of travel and drink in evening.

2. use canned wine, never heard about it before actually. I live in the Netherlands.

3. strap the bladder of a boxed wine somewhere and bring this.(I feel like my options of choice of wine are limited by this when buying here in the Netherlands)

4.just strapping a bottle to the frame and opening when using it in the evening(less preferred due too chances of breaking, and added weight and inconvenience when packing)"

My wife and I are planning a trip to Napa in December (first time) and were hoping for the community's help in selecting what experiences to prioritize. We are trying to prioritize beautiful properties, delicious wine, and unique experiences. Budget isn't a big issue but we would obviously want value in our bookings. So far we have the following:

**Day 1:**
Schramsberg Vineyards, Chappellet

**Day 2:**
Quintessa, Stagâ€™s Leap Wine Cellars, dinner at Auberge du Soleil 

**Day 3:**
Chateau Montelena, O'Shaughnessy Estate Winery (personal connection)

Any feedback is greatly appreciated!

EDIT.

Thanks to everyone who commented and DMâ€™d me.

We have moved things around a little and decided to drop SLWC and instead go to CADE Estate Winery and Opus One along with Quintessa on Day 2. We also canceled our reservation at Auberge du Soleil and made a reservation at PRESS.

Thanks!"

Their house had to go through water remediation and part of the process was to blast their basement with hot air machines, which unfortunately cooked all their wine. While the wine wasnâ€™t anything high end or fancy, there were certainly a couple of bottles which I was familiar with that I was definitely sad to hear were ruined. 

Nothing turned into vinegar or tasted like stewed fruits surprisingly. The main theme was that pretty much all of them tasted flat and smelled like nothing. They werenâ€™t disgusting, just veryâ€¦blah. Meh. Pretty much flavorless. 

The only exception was the 19 Crimes. It was terrible, but that probably wasnâ€™t due to the heat. The heat did seem to kill the nose, but I picked up some weird root beer, sarsaparilla, cream soda, cola note, definitely like fake sugary kind of note. 

On the palate, it was some kind of caramel and Dr Pepper with a hint of cherry robitussin. I almost spit it out because it was so nasty. 

It was honestly kind of exciting how bad it was, considering everything else was so flat. If youâ€™ve heard of movies that are so bad theyâ€™re good, this was almost like that, but with wine, and it wasnâ€™t actually good. But it was fun making fun of the 19 Crimes wine and very educational to taste the other wines that had been damaged by heat.

Oh - the Prosecco honestly wasnâ€™t too bad either, but La Marca isnâ€™t great to begin with, so the bar was pretty low, but it still had good fizz and didnâ€™t taste all that noticeably worse than a normal bottle! "

Paired well with dinner which was farmstand pork chops with crispy shallots and garlic butter served with roast acorn and delicata squash and Brussels sprouts with sage brown butter and crushed roasted hazelnuts. A little homemade cranberry sauce on the side, too. Probably a Chardonnay would have paired beautifully but I saw Collotte Marsannay in the shop and had to. "

So we had a bottle from 1974 and 2020.  Fortunately, the 74 was actually pretty good.  The color had faded a bit, and it had lost ""something"", but otherwise was enjoyable.

Balanced by graceful acidity. Bold while also Elegant. What every Grenache-based wine hopes it will be when it grows up. Really some of the best CDP I have ever had. Glad to have two more bottles. "

I'm a burgundy noob, so take my notes with a grain of salt.

Chateau De La Tour

Nose: Very balanced between red fruit, earth, tiny amount of spice, and a dusty note.

Palate: Very complex. Notes of spce, like black pepper, leather, tobacco, hints of red fruit. Very balanced. Also one unique note I can't describe, but it wasn't something I'm used to. Very high concentration of flavor, medium-high body

Finish: medium tannins, strong leather, dark chocolate, spice in the initial finish

Nicolas Rossignoe

Nose: More earthy on the nose, not much fruit, spice

Palate: Similar to the nose, earthy, leather, black pepper. Less concentration than the previous, slightly watery, but still very good.

Finish: Low tannins, but still present, slight amoumt of dark chocolate bitterness, good length

Two very good wines overall. I preferred the De La Tour, but these are basically my first two burgundies ever. Normally, we drink bordeaux, barolo, chianti, or Rioja and occasionally some new world wines, but not much Pinot in general. I did some research and found these wines over the past month and now I think I might have gotten some of my co-workers addicted to burgundy lol."

I've always felt Pichon Baron is capable of first growth tier wines and this vintage absolutely demonstrates that. 

Stood up 12 hours before drinking and opened two hours ahead of dinner. Decided to slow ox instead of decant, so the wine wouldn't fall apart.

Initially, needed time to open up, but after a couple hours, this was beautiful.

Notes of dark plum, dark cherry, arugula, allspice, and clove.

Long finish, mellow tannins and acidity.

This wine is at its peak, I think, but can also probably last for the new few decades.

94 points.

We did get to try some relatively expensive for us ($80-$120+ per bottle) wines, which is outside our typical $20-30 bottle table wine budget. However, the quality of these higher end wines was very apparent.  It got us thinking about increasing our budget to occasionally treat ourselves to one â€œexpensiveâ€ bottle every so often. But for that price, we want to be pretty confident weâ€™re going to enjoy it. Any advice on the best way to evaluate the value/quality of wine in this price range before making the purchase?

Objective criteria for wine quality,1,1gn59mk,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gn59mk/objective_criteria_for_wine_quality/,13,2024-11-09 15:00:14,"Hey r/wine! One thing that's been occupying my idle brain since ages is defining objective criteria for wine quality. Not a single score, definitely not a list of aromas and flavors, but relatively easily measurable characteristics that would correlate with the ""quality"", i.e, serve as a buying guideline for an intelligent but not-very-well-versed-in-wine-yet human.

Say, my wife sees Chateau TrouvÃ© for 20$, Chateau Perdu for 200$, and Chateau Ã‰garÃ© for 35$ in a shop. She checks the notes and they are like ""... minty-edge to the cedar, tobacco, cigar box..."", ""... dried roses, mint, tobacco, dried cherries..."", ""... mint, smoke, cherries and raspberries..."" â€” absolutely unhelpful for her to make a choice (she grabs the one with the nicest label or the one with more medals). What I think would help her, or some redditors here, to make an informed decision, is to mention that, say, the bottle of Ã‰garÃ© for 35 bucks is better balanced and is a bit more complex than TrouvÃ© for 20$.

Not sure asking AI helps (yet?). For example, Gemini seems to care more about classification, reputation, and critic reviews, not to mention it often gets basic facts wrong.

With that, here are a few of my criteria to seed the discussion:

* Balance, both in main compounds (acid, alcohol, sugar, polyphenols) and in taste perception

* Duration of the aftertaste

* Complexity of the story the wine tells, e.g., ""light and fruity nose but surprisingly deep note of cherry that evolves into whatnot and becomes thisthat...""

Iâ€™m erring on the side of all of them being dead.  Certainly going to open these up over time, and I will definitely report back. Left to right..

Petrus 1970.  Mid low shoulder fill.  Insanely depressed cork. I want so bad for this to be a miracleâ€¦

Haut Brion 1974 - Iâ€™d bet everything that this is toast. Never seen such low ullage. Iâ€™m still gonna open it up and smell it. Who knows? The bottle is a really interesting shape. 

Weingut Dr. Alex Senfter - nierfteiner Orbel Riesling Beerenauslese 1976 - this one has a nice looking level, but brown glass makes it hard to tell whatâ€™s inside.  Kinda have some hope for this one..

Beaulieu Vineyard private reserve 1971 - if only the petrus had the fill level of this one.  Decent cork and capsule position. Cellar tracker notes are not inspiring, but Iâ€™d be glad to open this up for science.

Porto Barros 1890 - I started shaking when I picked this one up haha. Not too familiar with ports this old.  The wax on the capsule is super crusty looking. The fill level is right to the top of the shoulder.  I have pretty high hopes for this one.

Offley Vintage Port 1963 - upper mid shoulder fill. Cork seems a little depressed.

Wasnt familiar with the producer, but plenty of available info!Grapes harvested on September 7, 2019 - then 15 months ageing on fine lees. Stored at 55, popped and poured - no decanting. Paired with a grilled salmon and some rice.

Visually, a strong ruby color, hints of purple at the edge. Beautiful color.

On the nose, I went in expecting the usual red fruits of a gamay - was incredibly surprised to pick up herbs and spices reminiscent of the Southern Rhone! Less flowers than I expected. Deeper into the glass, blueberries - with a hint of the usual strawberries and cherries I expected. Fantastic scents for a gamay, I'm sure partly thanks to the terroir of this Cru.

On the palate - medium bodied, yet still refreshing to drink. A pleasant tannin grip, perhaps I should've aired it out a little - yet balanced, with a good bit of acidity. No notable burn at all (label shows it as 11-14% ABV? Wild LOL. Never seen an abv >range< before.) Dry. Flavors of blackberry pie, blueberry jam - bit of pepper at the tail end. The herbs continue - a fantastic bit of complexity at the price point. Nice long finish. This was $25?

My first Cote-de-Brouilly, and I'm absolutely blown away here. The nose, the palate - fantastic value here. Delicious in every way, and I cant wait to track down other producers. Highly recommended!!"

Would require longer post but ended up tasting 80 wines (a lot of 2023 vintage) and traveling up and down the CÃ´te dâ€™Or. While it is difficult and often impossible to buy wine from the winery I did get a few. I found this bottle locally back near NYC while I wait for my shipment to come. 

 Tasting notes-
No fruit, lots of spice, tobacco, forest floor. Moderate tannins and a medium finish. I think in a few years when the fruit may come out it will be more balanced. 
No regrets opening a young bottle, was worth it to remember the trip. "

So far I've explored a bunch of red wines and figured out what I **don't like:**

1. Heavy, full, overly sweet reds (e.g. a lot of California reds like Zinfandel/Cabs)

2. Musty, chocolate, spicy, earthy tones

  
What I **do like:**

1. Lighter wines (leaning dry, but some amount of sweetness is nice)

2. Love love the chillable red wines

3. Floral/fruity scent/taste but not toooo sweet

4. Generally, I've found that the wines I like have a translucent/transparent reddish color? (like a french pinot/gamay?)

"2020 Domaine de Leyre-Loup Fleurie | Too much Cru Beaujolais, not enough time!",9,1gmqth4,https://i.redd.it/greitv5fbqzd1.jpeg,1,2024-11-09 02:27:42,"Purchased a bottle to go along with dinner at a local wine bar, No Reservations, in Miami - was in the mood for some Cru Beaujolais when I walked in, so happy to see it on the menu! Paired with grilled lamb chops. Served a little cold (felt like 35-40), but warmed up as the night went on - not decanted.

Visually, a strong purple color - once I put my flash to it!

On the nose, bountiful floral scents at the rim - a bouquet of lovely fresh flowers on a spring day. Deeper into the glass, strong notes of ripe strawberries and cherries. Took a bit to open up - but I pin that more on the serving temperature than anything.

On the palate, fantastically crisp and refreshing, especially chilled. Lightly bodied, pleasant acidity, barely any notable tannin grip - par for the course with the grape. Dry, with perceived sweetness due to the strong ripe red fruit flavor more so than any actual sugar. That same nose of cherries and strawberries resumed on the palate, bountiful red fruit. Delicious, albeit no real complexity of flavor to me. Decent finish, and a great pairing with the lightly seasoned lamb and vegetable salad.

The bottle went for $58, but the host reduced it to $29 for me, and for a restaurant bottle at that point, I was definitely very satisfied with the value (since $58 gets me some good Big 4 Morgon). Took half the bottle home where it promptly didn't survive the night. Will happily continue pursuing Fleurie and the other Crus (eyeing a particular Cote de Brouilly for tonight)! Looking up the producer online, I was happy to see them using very sustainable and organic farming methods, which will have me choose them again soon. Recommended! 

(Oh, and for any locals, the wine bar I mention above is fantastic)"

Great communication, and we ended up spending nearly three hours there. Seeing their horses, cellar, production facility, historic home, and vines was one of the highlights of our trip. The clarets and field blends were great and extremely interesting blends. The work theyâ€™ve done on their property and vines is evident in the product and the passion for what theyâ€™re doing. They were even kind enough to share what was left of a 92 vintage Niepoort (a birth year for several of us). 

We ended up buying several bottles and left with a few gifts from u/aligotegozaimasu as well! Their hospitality and kindness was above and beyond, and we couldnâ€™t have been more thankful for the time they spent to show us their work. If you make it to Portugal, I couldnâ€™t recommend them enough.

Lately it became a burden as you always have to wash the bottle and to store them. Sometimes it's even pointless because you are not sure how much is going to be drunk. Sometimes my wife only wants 100ml and I don't, and I need even smaller bottles to preserve the rest. 

It's a mess and I want to throw all my empty bottles away.

I made some research into plastics, and as we all know the plastic is not really good for preserving stuff, but advancements in plastics have been made, specifically HDPE is a type of plastic that is highly inert and is also used in reusable water bottles. The main advantage here is that they are squishable so I never have to pour it in another bottle when I need just a little wine.

But most of the bottles that I find for sale don't look nice to keep wine inside. Maybe someone can suggest a specific brand.

"Mousiness in Wine - Would you send a bottle back? If so, when?",6,1glzze5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1glzze5/mousiness_in_wine_would_you_send_a_bottle_back_if/,29,2024-11-08 03:17:27,"Hello everybody,

just had a lovely meal in Paris with a bottle of wine that was pleasant to start, but unfortunately became noticeably mousey within 45 minutes. I'm more than open to natural wines, and have served and sold many, but typically I'm more used to wines that turn around the second day mark and was unpleasantly surprised that this was so noticeably faulty before the mains even hit the table.

This got me thinking about the changes in the dynamics of wine consumption and how the industry reacts to it. The whole process of tasting a wine prior to serving is focused on cork taint... So while working as a Somm, I would accept a return from a guest where the cork taint became prominent over time (ie not noticed immediately upon serving to the guest), I don't know how I would feel about a wine that became mousey over the course of a meal... Conversely, as a guest, I didn't feel comfortable returning a wine that had become mousey (even though it happened so fast).

I feel like I'm rambling a bit, but I'm curious - if you're eating in a restaurant, under what circumstances would you return a bottle of wine that had gone mousey? Do you think mousiness is given more of a ""free pass"" than other taints? And if so, do you think thats fair?

Hopefully I'm not opening a can of worms here but I'm interested. Both as someone who is neither staunchly pro or anti natural wine, but also as a consumer who is usually on the other side of the interaction.

Appreciate your insights. Cheers."

I think I picked it up for $80. Fill was high shoulder. Cork was fragile, but uncompromised. Had a couple of small glasses with some homemade lasagna. It was really solid. Color was a perfect red amber. Tobacco, black pepper, dark fruit, and tar on the palate. Well-balanced with a lengthy finish. Pleasant acidity. Pulled the original cork and re-corked with new, so I could use my Coravin. That's usually my move on these older bottles. Now I can finish the bottle over the next few weeks, with a small glass here and there. As an aside, I've noticed wines, while protected from ruin, do continue to evolve after tapping with the Coravin. So, I expect it will continue to improve over the coming days. "

Quick question. I bought this 2016 Barolo online (through 8Wines).

Furthermore, this label advertises 16%, while I have read some reviews saying their label notes 15%. Is this something to be worried about, or am I being paranoid?

When it's warm the compressor kicks in fine and cools to maintain an accurate temperature of 13Â°c as set.

 However when the temperature drops and it attempts to heat something is going wrong and the unit is tripping my mcbs on the electrical distribution board.

Does anyone have manuals or an understanding of how the unit provides heating before I empty it out and dismantle it to attempt a fix?

Am tempted to just leave it for the winter and wait for spring hoping it insulated well enough to keep the temperature stable.

Quintessa: known for its long history of organic/biodynamic winemaking practices. 91% Cab Sauv and 60% new French oak. Dark berry fruit and granular, smooth tannins. Great acidity. 

Ornellaia: Bolgheri blend of 62% Cab Sauv, 31% Merlot, and a dappling of Petite Verdot and Cab Franc. Chalky tannins, earthy, tomato vine, and a jab of VA that improved with time in the glass. This one needs the most time to show itself out of all the wines tasted today.

I have a few go to vineyards that I know are good and cheap, but Iâ€™d like to expand on that. 

So, imagine youâ€™re in a supermarket (thatâ€™s where I usually go if I donâ€™t want to spend a fortune), you donâ€™t know any of the wines, and your Vivino app isnâ€™t working.  You know what occasion you need it for (meal, pre dinner, sparkly and whatever). How do you pick out a bottle?

Are there any information on the bottle, country, the price, the grape or anything that helps you decide? Iâ€™d imagine going for offers lets your money stretch to a better wine, but more expensive doesnâ€™t always equal better in my limited experience. 

Let me know your thought process"

2009 Drouhin Oregon Chardonnay REVIEW,44,1gkosej,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gkosej,4,2024-11-06 10:05:03,"Updating from an earlier post, with my first review here on r/wine! 

Iâ€™ve slowly gotten into the wine world over the last few years, and working in the fine dining industry, Iâ€™m lucky to be exposed to a lot of higher level bottles and people who are amazing and willing to share. My first epiphany moment with wine, the sip that turned on the light bulb, was a 2010 Roulot white burgundy. I was so intrigued and so thrown off by the amount of flavors and textures and feelings that the wine thrust upon me, I didnâ€™t know how to react. Following this experience, I was sent into a two year foray into white burgundy and have found myself with significantly lighter pockets since. As an avid drinker of Nebbiolo and lover of Italy, I had sworn France to be overrated and dull. Boy, did this day prove me wrong! 

Ive been chasing that dragon since, and landed on Meursault and Pouilly-Fuisse, or more southern burg whites as my palettes choice due to the richness, creaminess, and more oak, as opposed to higher acid and steely-clean, crisp Chablis counterparts. 

Today, we have a bottle that intrigued me when I saw it, excited me when I got home and did some research, and blew my mind when I opened it. 

2009 Drouhin â€œArthurâ€ Oregon Chardonnay, found this among 4-5 more, covered in dust in a south Florida liquor store. Hereâ€™s my novice review so we can all get this over withâ€¦

Med-deep gold color, almost amber, gold flake and perfectly hued. Intense nose, flooded with deep, rich, and creamy apple orchard notes, little bit of flint, lot of brown butter and seriously (SERIOUSLY) heavy popcorn, but it was so good, no chemical traces, just organic pure old butter. Insanity. Wine was dry, weighty, but so well integrated, little bit of tannin (from oak maybe?) but it was so dang smooth. Medium acid, high alcohol, full body, intense flavor, crazy long finish. This wine is outstanding and was preserved so well! 
Iâ€™m going to buy the rest tomorrow. Overall 9/10 and blew my expectations out of the water. So balanced, so tertiary. Rich and smooth oak, toasted sourdough, kombucha and apples, buuuttterr, brown butter, more butterâ€¦. Lots of vanilla and little nutmeg, soft cheeseâ€¦ marmaladeâ€¦ man it just keeps going. Thanks for reading and if you see one of these, I canâ€™t recommend it enough. The age has done this wine such a service and Iâ€™d say this is its prime. "

Disznoko 6 puttonyos 1993 from this weekend ,69,1gklu1v,https://i.redd.it/4wa1pyc4e6zd1.jpeg,4,2024-11-06 07:27:20,"I went to an event this weekend where I knew this bottle would be properly appreciated so decided now was as good a time as ever to open it. I've got one more stored away and I think I'll plan to keep it until about 2030 based off tasting this one. 

This like most post 1990 disznoko is a spectacular example of what tokaji can be. I opened this bottle for about 15min and then decided to decant and start to taste after another 15-20min in the decanter. We ended up drinking it over the next hour. 

Upon starting to drink this it was extremely bright, lemon curd, dried apricot, fresh ginger, white peaches, and the trademark botytris funk. Still quite fresh and lively. Weighty and sweet but had substantial acid to back it up. Over time it got a bit more subdued on acidity and came really into balance and opened up to where I feel it was ideal after around an hour or so open. Towards the end of the bottle it did begin to lean a little bitter and flabby as it had started falling off. Still plenty of life left but definitely thinking it will be in its prime with only a quick decant off sediment before drinking with good company in 5-6 years. "

All the terminology of styles is in English language rather then Portuguese (except for ""Colheita"").   
Its perceived as having a sort of an aristocratic personality.   
In reality none of those perceptions is wrong. But instead of attracting people, it scares them away.

I have the feeling that most people has not had a first good experience with Port. There's a lot of basic/cheap Port flooding the shelves and very little top tier cuveÃ©s or older blends...

  
I would love to know your opinion. How do you look at Port? Have you had a good/very good experience?

I did a lot of research and was confident that â€˜86 was a good year for the left bank and that there was a decent chance this still had some life in it. Fill level was good and all indicators pointed to a trustworthy provenance. I was still nervous as hell that something would be wrong with it. 

Decanted off the sediment and poured a taste right away. Holy shit if it wasnâ€™t still very much intact but downright ALIVE from the first sip. 38+ years later and this thing STILL had fruit. It was mostly tertiary, yes, but the fruit that was there was still identifiable. 

Currant, dried berries and touch of persimmon. Leather, tobacco and a toasty earthiness. The tannin had softened to the point of a fine grit sandpaper, but still added a noticeable mouthfeel and body. Med+ body and long finish. 

I canâ€™t even explain how much this thing changed over the evening. With every sip, every glass, it continued to evolve as if it were doing summersaults. Sometimes the tertiary dominated. Sometimes the fruit popped forward. It was crazy but always in balance.

For food, I made beech mushroom toasts with magic dust seasoning from the hitching post and a red wine reduction. Those were aimed at the Pinots and paired well.

For the Bordeaux blends it was cheeseburgers with onion rings. Gave them smoke to 115 and then finished on a skillet. Seasoned with oregano, mushroom powder, sumac, basil, and nutmeg. Onion rings got hop cat crack fries seasoning. A little sweet. "

Help!!! Buying red wine as a special gift!,1,1gjqr34,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gjqr34/help_buying_red_wine_as_a_special_gift/,15,2024-11-05 05:07:28,"Hello all you wine enthusiasts! 

This post is coming from someone that knows extremely little about wine... like next to nothing.

A very special friend of mine is having a big birthday this year and I would like to get him a wonderful bottle of red wine given that he loves red wine.

Through the grapevine (pun intended), I have heard that he likes Cabernet Sauvignon.

I would love to spend under $120, but if there is something that's slightly more that's truly spectacular, I will do my best to still buy it depending on how much ""slightly more"" is.

Any suggestions would be IMMENSELY appreciated!

I'm not sure if I'm going to get that many responses, so thank you in advance to anyone that responds! ðŸ™"
"Have you ever advised, inserted yourself, or helped out an aging person with their wine collection?",5,1gjp4q4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gjp4q4/have_you_ever_advised_inserted_yourself_or_helped/,10,2024-11-05 04:00:37,"TL;DR - have you advised or helped out any aging wine collector population on the need to ""move"" wines, drink them, or get rid of stuff before it ages out? Even my healthy and hip Dad at 80 has a collection that isn't moving as fast, and I suspect we're seeing stuff die, and I feel like I should involve myself a bit.

\---------

I've worked my whole career in food and beverage in kitchens and front of house, then rooms ops and hospitality, eventually leading to design/build stuff, all since 1995. I've seen builds and helped with some wine rooms, in ideal and not so ideal situations. Then you move on... and old school inventory control still meant directors would ignore / miss some wine, or not sell it so it ages out and is no longer good. That's a bummer. It wasn't under my management, but I've seen some pretty stellar wine inventories get into disarray. It breaks your heart to see stuff turn or get ignored.

That being said, I notice baby boomers are both not traveling, nor eating or drinking, like they used to. Their cellars are full, and it's part of the ding the industry is having in re-inventing, modernizing, reaching new audiences, and competing with this temperance movement, weed, and interest in seltzers (the new Zima, Bartles and James, Smirnoff Ice, and this too shall pass). But they can't rely on boomers to buy, with as full as some of those cellars are!

But I do think there are a lot of personal collections that are turning. I mean, I'm 48 and I'm shocked what the pandemic did to my brain and time... I keep thinking a bunch of my collection is just 3 to 5 years old, and all of a sudden it's 15 years old, etc. So I realize there's a bunch of baby boomer collections that aren't being drunk as rapidly, and there are absolutely a bunch of cellars all over the world that just has turning or dead wines, and I want to know if any of you have done anything to prevent that?

I don't mean pilfering or self-interest, but have any of you helped a parent or friend by auditing a collection and sort of organizing what should be drunk or at least considered before it expires? How'd it go? 

I think this question might be extremely silly, so I might delete. Just curious if people have started seeing wine collections get ignored, sort of abandoned, and good stuff turning over time. Cheers all.

Visiting Jerez - Field Report & Recommendations,20,1gjonqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gjonqf/visiting_jerez_field_report_recommendations/,13,2024-11-05 03:41:28,"With Sherry Week kicking off today, I wanted to share my experience and recommendations from a trip to the incredible region of Jerez in early October.

**Background**: Iâ€™m based in Poland and got interested in Sherry two years ago through WSET 2. Earlier this year, I completed an intermediate course by Consejo Regulador Vinos de Jerez. I donâ€™t speak Spanish.

**Getting There**: Reaching Jerez is surprisingly easy. While thereâ€™s a small airport, taking the train is likely the simplest route, either from Madrid (\~4 hours) or Seville (\~1 hour).

**Getting Around**: The key bodegas (wineries) are in Jerez, SanlÃºcar de Barrameda, and El Puerto de Santa MarÃ­a. A convenient bus from Jerez (near the train station) goes to SanlÃºcar, and thereâ€™s a quick train to El Puerto. Iâ€™d advise against renting a carâ€”Sherry is fortified, and one tasting alone can be potent! Public transport is reliable, so thereâ€™s no need to drive.

**Arrival in Jerez**: We arrived in Jerez on a Sunday and stayed at a comfortable, reasonably priced accommodation booked through Booking. October wasnâ€™t crowded with tourists, and the weather was fantastic. The city is compact, very walkable, and filled with beautiful architecture. I wish I had more time to explore, but of course, the main goal was to drink Sherry!

The city is full of bars, particularly â€œtabancosâ€ (Sherry bars), where a glass ranges from 1â‚¬ to 5â‚¬. The quality is usually great, though there are occasional misses.

**Dining at La CarbonÃ¡**: On our first night, we had a reservation at La CarbonÃ¡ (https://maps.app.goo.gl/mJ411xqBpQS7KJ9X7), recommended by this subreddit. We chose the â€œLola CarbonÃ¡â€ tasting menu, which was 75â‚¬ per person and included 7 dishes paired with 7 different Sherries. Though there were some minor slip-ups (a shell in the seafood and limited English), the experience was a fantastic start to our trip.

**Exploring SanlÃºcar de Barrameda**: Early the next day, we took the bus to SanlÃºcar, a smaller seaside town with plenty of charm. Our first stop was Bodegas Hidalgo la Gitana (https://bodegashidalgolagitana.com/), which was incredible! The cathedral-like bodega building was awe-inspiring, and the tour was both informative and fun. For 19,50â‚¬, we tasted four Sherries, including two drawn directly from barrels with a traditional *venencia*. You even get to keep a branded glass as a memento. We left with a bottle of their Manzanilla Pastrana.

Afterward, we wandered to Bodegas ArgÃ¼eso (https://maps.app.goo.gl/YGtMGLEBheHYvbbP8) for a quick, free tasting in their shop. It was a good experience, though language was a bit of a barrier.

Our walk to Bodega Delgado Zuleta (https://maps.app.goo.gl/GXaJk9PvhGrDHRr29) led us to a pleasant surprise at Bodegas BarÃ³n (https://maps.app.goo.gl/zrCPuwmoGh5c84Vj9). Despite the language gap, the friendly staff gave us an impromptu tasting directly from the barrels. We ended up buying a bottle of their Manzanilla Pasada.

At Delgado Zuleta, we didnâ€™t have a reservation, but a kind staff member offered us a small free tasting. We sampled five or six different Sherries and bought a bottle of their Amontillado.

After a day full of tasting, we enjoyed a meal at Taberna der Guerrita (https://maps.app.goo.gl/qdwEh9vkcw4D6nuC6), another spot recommended here. The tapas were incredible, andâ€”perhaps inspired by all the Sherryâ€”we accidentally ordered bullâ€™s testicles! Also, be sure to check out their *trastienda*, a shop filled with Sherries.

**Sherry Museum at Bodegas Barbadillo**: We wrapped up SanlÃºcar with a stop at a small museum in Bodegas Barbadillo, which is worth a visit. Naturally, there was another tasting in the shop before we headed back to Jerez with five bottles in my backpack.

**Flamenco Night in Jerez**: That evening, we went to Tabanco El Pasaje (https://maps.app.goo.gl/WdU6Vhakca2TxiA4A) for a flamenco show. Although itâ€™s a popular tourist spot, the ambiance was great. We ordered a premium tapas set and enjoyed a house Amontillado that was so good we ordered another. The show itself was intense at first but very captivating.

**Touring the Iconic Bodegas**: The next morning, we visited Bodegas Lustau (https://lustau.es/en/) for a 30â‚¬ tour that included 7 Sherries (one VORS) and a vermouth. It was an amazing experience, and we bought a VORS bottle.

Later, we went to the renowned Bodega Tio Pepe (https://www.tiopepe.com/es-es/reserva). While the 24,90â‚¬ tour (4 Sherries included) was enjoyable, it felt a bit commercial with amusements like ""Sherry train ride.""

**Bodegas TradiciÃ³n**: Our final day began at Bodegas TradiciÃ³n (https://bodegastradicion.es/), which was absolutely outstanding. We received a private tour (as we were the only guests that day) with Ãgueda, who adapted her guidance to our deeper knowledge of Sherry. Afterward, we explored the ownerâ€™s private art collection, featuring Spanish masterpieces by artists like El Greco, VelÃ¡zquez or Goya. The tasting included two VOS, three VORS, and one Fino, all truly exceptional. This premium experience costs 55â‚¬ per person but is absolutely worth it.

**Final Stops**: Our last stop was Bodegas Fundador (https://brandyfundador.com/visita-bodega/), a large-scale bodega with a 30â‚¬ tour featuring three VORS. Afterward, we visited Vinos y Licores La Estrella (https://maps.app.goo.gl/aSXtcEMo37nSkkkr7) for a few final bottles before attempting a visit to the Consejo Regulador (https://maps.app.goo.gl/T7bcD9ZfdCJCZUh58), which, unfortunately, was closed during declared opening hours.

**Final Thoughts**: My trip to Jerez was unforgettable, and Iâ€™ll definitely be backâ€”maybe even next year. The region and its wines seem vastly underrated, which keeps prices affordable. And I still need to explore El Puerto!

**Bonus Tips**: If youâ€™re nearby, consider visiting Cadiz (a short train ride) and Seville. In Cadiz, GorriÃ³n (https://maps.app.goo.gl/NKt4MntEayq4EUfV7) is a great wine bar, while Baco Vinos (https://maps.app.goo.gl/mVEAHMfmXMtF8b3A8) is a well-stocked shop with English-speaking staff. Taberna La Manzanilla (https://maps.app.goo.gl/K9g5NUCgbu8VtzGj9) serves exclusively Sherries, many aged to VOS or VORS but declassified. In Seville, Vinoteca Lama La Uva (https://maps.app.goo.gl/55yxN3KHdSAu3o137) has an excellent selection and very kind, English-speaking owner, and Bar Casa Morales (https://maps.app.goo.gl/uxGHgZuVVxHSjUhQA) offers affordable, authentic, delicious experiences (the secret to get inside is to try all three different entrances).

Cheers, folks! Enjoy your Sherryâ€”not only this week!

Balade oenologique tasting package,13,1gjndkh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gjndkh,2,2024-11-05 02:49:17,"This is a tasting package of samples of BIO French wines. It's a blind tasting, you can read what you drank afterwards and they also provide tasting notes in French(see last images). I wrote my tasting notes before reading theirs, seems like for some of them we agreed for others not so much :) . First wine is no. 2, I forgot to take a picture of wine 1, it looked pretty similar to no 2 if a bit lighter maybe.

Wine 1
Sweet, apricot smell on the nose, as well as a bit of yeasty character and floral notes.
On the palate, quite acidic, and somewhat fruity, citrus with a bit of pear and apricot. Yeasty character persists on the palate.
Finish is more yeasty than anything else, lingering for a bit.

Wine 2
On the nose, pretty fruity, I think peach, yeasty notes here as well. The fruit persists on the palate, with a bit of a subtle thyme and oregano note going on as well, with the yeasty character here too. It also reminds me a bit of maybe a very fresh fruit tart? I don't know how to put it better. Quite savory, the finish is somewhat short. An interesting wine

Wine 3
A rose wine. On the nose, I'm honestly not getting much except for a slight floral note. On the palate, it's fruity, maybe some sort of red forest fruit, but again somewhat faint. The finish is surprisingly long and powerful, much more clear redcurrant than when you just taste it first. 

Wine 4
The first red wine. This is a light red wine, with musky and floral notes on the nose. Quite acidic, with light tannins. Body is thin. Definitely looks like Pinot Noir. I'm getting notes of cherry, plum and some almost tomato like savory note. In enjoyed this wine.

Wine 5

A much more corpolent red wine. On the nose, forest floor and redcurrant. Moderate acidity and tannins. Quite pleasant, easy-drinking but still somewhat powerful. I'm getting redcurrant and just berries in general. A bit of dried plum as well, especially on the finish. Finish is quite prolonged. 

Wine 6

A dark red wine. Pretty strong eucalyptus on the nose. Besides that, I'm also getting an almost cherry cola like note on the nose. Moderate acidity and somewhat strong tannins. The eucalyptus persists on the palate, being however complemented by cherry as well as dark fruit notes, such as blackcurrant and I think blackberry. Quite savory, long finish. Quite a complex wine, I really enjoyed this one.

And holy hell, what did I watch?!? This was peak 2000s douchebro stuff, and like most movies from this decade, to say it's not aging well would be an understatement. 

I also don't think I've ever watched a movie with two main characters who were so unlikeable with 2 hours of just lying to everyone about everything. Maybe because I didn't see it new, that I missed the cultural zeitgeist that this movie did to Pinot and SBC wine country? 

On the other hand, most of us know someone eerily similar to Miles. Complete with the over the top pontificating about tasting notes when they don't even know that Cheval Blanc is Cab Franc and Merlot. 

I also liked how they tied the 1961 CB to their own lives as 40 somethings who seemingly have already peaked, but the general feel of the movie is just too much 00s cringefest for me. "

Life got in the way and I donâ€™t want to drink it until the perfect moment (not rushing, etc). So itâ€™s been in the fridge upright for a month now.

Kirkland 2023 Russian River Valley Pinot Noir,1,1gj5mdu,https://i.redd.it/6wney2a95tyd1.jpeg,6,2024-11-04 10:54:25,"Being relatively new to Costco, the idea of a serviceable weekday pinot noir (from the RRV AVA no less) for only $12 seemed intriguing.

Itâ€™s not as good as I hoped it would be, however, it managed to beat out the Belle Glos I reviewed a few days ago. Anywayâ€¦.

A little sweet for a pinot, and slightly heavier in mouthfeel than average, but for $12 itâ€™s not unbearably so. Itâ€™s just enough to remind you that youâ€™re drinking a mass produced pinot where some corners have been cut, and some liberties taken.

This is all red fruit, with cherry, raspberry, and strawberry. No dark fruit here to really speak of. Immediately following is the earthy notes of oak, smoke, and leather. Normally tasting notes of smoke and leather in wine is something that I absolutely love, but the residual sugar, vanilla, and heavier mouthfeel cloud over it all. Medium to medium-high acidity, although the slightly heavier mouthfeel impacts the versatility. 

Not bad, but also not something Iâ€™d buy as a weekday staple. This is a wine you bring to a party as an afterthought. I would drink this if served it, but this will remain a house party ice bucket bottle. 

My current weekday pinot staple remains Pacific Redwoodâ€™s Organic Pinot. At only $17 per bottle, Iâ€™ll gladly pay that small premium to get a much better product, even if it is usually a bitch to find.

This wine had a garnet color with a vivid ruby rim. I picked up notes of black cherries, peppercorn, and cedar with a hint of flint. With a medium body and a delightfully long finish, I found this wine to be thoroughly enjoyable. It holds up to many of the tempranillos Iâ€™ve tasted from Rioja while having unique flinty undertones. $17.89. 91 points.

A liquor store has the wine in the title (2021), which is normally â‚¬42, but is now on discount to â‚¬31.50. It's still a bit of a high price for what I usually want to spend, but I'm willing to spend it on something I think I'll enjoy (e.g. last week I picked up a 2007 Colheita port from Dow's for a similar price that I'm thoroughly enjoying).

I'll explain my tastes so that you have more information to recommend buying/not buying a bottle. I tend to far prefer fortified wine, port especially, but I'm currently in the process of learning more about wine since I want to explore the wine world. I tend to prefer white wine over red. I (somewhat) like chardonnay, but am not a big fan of sauvignon blanc. In terms of red, the ones I like the most are pinotage and shiraz, but don't really like cabernet sauvignon. I also like procescco.

I received a hearty recommendation for Chapoutier from someone I know that very much enjoys wine, and tried a bit of pinot noir from Chapoutier, which was pretty good. That's why I'm considering this bottle. I also bought a bottle of CÃ´tes du Rhone and CÃ´tes du Rhone Blanc from Chapoutier, but those two won't be opened for now (since there are several open bottles that need to be finished first), meaning I don't have a base point of comparison.

Would you guys recommend buying the bottle? Sorry if it's quite a lot of text for what might be an easy yes or no for you, but I'm curious about the wine and don't want to potentially waste my money."

Oxidation, med amber. I see some viscosity as well.
I pick up dried orange slices, dried dates, mushrooms and cedar.
On palate, I want to say old strawberry jam, ginseng, and cinnamon.
Intensity I would have to say low+, low acidity, offdry, short.

I kept it in a small decanter to see if it developed any further, but nothing other than increase in acidity.  Before turning into vinegar, I made into a reduction to top on vanilla ice cream.

Light straw in color with very fine and light bubbles. 

A bit closed on the nose but gentle aroma of brioche, lime skin, candied lemon, grape soda.

On the palate, brioche, green apple, mandarin, lemon peel, lime cordial, with a bit of flinty minerals on the finish which is very long. 

Overall wanting a bit more on the nose but a very luscious and easy drinking champagne with a beautiful lingering finish.

92+ points.

1972 Taylor Fladgate Late-Bottled Vintage Port:

Deep copper in color, slight cloudiness and small amount of sediment.

On the nose, golden raisin, milk chocolate, caramel, cinnamon, dates.

On the palate, confirming the nose with hints of dried candied orange peel and baking spices.

A bit more diluted, and reflective of a somewhat weaker vintage but enjoyable nonetheless.

My go-to reliable whites for casual drinking. I can never say no to a bottle when I'm out searching for more bottles, and at a comfortably priced $15 at my local wine shop, an easy purchase to try out a new producer. Stored at 45, popped and poured - to note, it's a screwcap! Sipped sans pairing on the first night, paired with grilled chicken and potatoes on day two.

On the nose, faint floral scents at the rim - honeysuckle and citrus blossom. Further in, familiar notes of grapefruit, lemon - surprisingly no stone fruit, as I would've expected - faint apple. The first night it smelled like an entry level Bordeaux Sauv Blanc (some melon waved hello) - but on day two, the scent was much more what I'm used to from the region. Strong citrus. 

On the palate, quite light - medium dry, so there is a tasty bit of sweetness. Not as much acidity as I would've hoped, a little restrained in that regard for my tastes. Also, at 12.5%, zero noticeable burn to speak of. In composition, a super easy drinker! Flavors of apples, lemon, lime - none of the nutty flavors I've grown to love in higher end examples of the appellation - very citrus dominant, like the nose. It's still in the mid 80s here in Florida, so a great white wine to enjoy chilled outside.

At the price point, I still favor Maison Darragon or Famille Bougrier, but it's still a good example of entry level Vouvray - refreshing and tasty. Recommended! "

Honestly very happy w this since Iâ€™ve had much worse canned wines 

Iâ€™d say it was good because it was well balanced and lingered nicely. Maybe it had enough notes to have depth but not enough for me to be confidant saying so and not intense enough to tick that box.

So clean yet full of flavour, current vintage sold out on the first batch they made (i tried to get a few more bottles but no luck), portugal is back on track (the cheap bulk wines in europe moved from the south to the east of europe so they have to move as well and they did).

Another producer from that region Filipa Pato, also recommanded.

Proud of their region, local grapes. 10 euro a glass at the bar, i guess 20-25 euro a bottle local price. 

So much flavour and freshness at the same time, low alcohol due to the atlantic ocean. 

WOW, also the same in Germany, France and Italy. Be authentic and dont mess around too much, wine without makeup is the slogan from Filipa Pato.

I was only in Portugal for 4 days, but it will get a more prominent place in my wine cellar."

These are becoming my two go-to Barolos for highest QPR. The Vajra I feel is pretty commonly suggested to punch higher than the price. The Vietti is a staple producer and is hard to go wrong. For between $35-$45 itâ€™s hard to beat this. 

Do you have any suggestions that you feel are better for high QPR in this region?

Notes: I had these both earlier today so I have to  off memory so my post doesnâ€™t get removed. 

Vajra: classic brick Barolo color, bright red cherry, rose, tar, slight licorice. Medium high tannin, medium high acidity. Lots of fresh red fruit, well balanced. 92.

Vietti: Slightly more ruby than brick. Also lots of bright red fruit, tar, almost a meaty scent as well to it. Extremely smooth tannins balanced with a bright acidity. Well balanced and potential to cellar. 93.

Opened 1 Sizies and it was was corked but luckily this second one was singing. 21 years old and plenty of vibrant fruit. Firm texture I expect of Beaune with forest floor, dried flowers and a hint of barnyard all playing second fiddle to black cherries, macerated strawberries and raspberry notes. All bursting from the glass. Palate is also a mouthful of ripe red fruits with whispers of earth, flowers and spice. Finish is not incredibly long but sufficient to warrant this 1er cru's reputation. After about an hour in the glass, tertiary notes begin to take over and the age shows. The fruit doesn't disappear but it steps into the background for all the earthy funky floral notes to pop out. Onto the Sancerre Rouge. Obviously more a contrast than comparison but wow what a difference! Smoky, dark and brooding. My fiancÃ©, who's notes I love, said it smells like a pirate. Big, big nose wafting out of the glass. Blackberries and cassis, aforementioned smoke, baking spices. Almost smells more Rhone than Loire. Same on the palate. Full bodied, silky tannins, well balanced overall. Ripe fruit, complex secondary notes, long finish. Cheaper than the Burgundy, too. (I suppose that's a given these days.) Both paired quite nicely with Chinese food. (Pinot and Chinese is one of my go-to's.) Cheers!"

Napa Sauv. blanc - help me understand (and possibly help my marriage),13,1ghvs5y,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1ghvs5y/napa_sauv_blanc_help_me_understand_and_possibly/,41,2024-11-02 19:54:58,"Hello!

My wife and I made a trip through Napa valley this summer (first time!) and went to St. Supery based on a recommendation from a friend.  They are well known for their sauvignon blancs, which are spectacular.  We liked their wines so much we joined their club even though we're on the east coast.  We have not EVER joined a club before, so that's how much we liked their stuff.

Fast forward a bit, and we have received a few shipments.  One of these wines - specifically [this one](https://www.stsupery.com/product/2023-rutherford-estate-vineyard-sauvignon-blanc/) \- is causing a disagreement between us.  While the taste is still wonderful, the wine has a strong, pungent, wet wool, dirty sock smell.  It his me in the face...this is not a subtle note.  But, my wife doesn't smell it at all, and thinks I'm nuts.  Usually she's the one that's able to identify flavors and notes more than me, so this is surprising.  This has happened with two different bottles form two different shipments, so I don't think it's related to an anomaly in storage, cork, etc.

I have a few questions for the experts here:

1 - Is this smell unique to the one drinking?  Is this sort of a cilantro/soap situation where I can smell the odor, but my wife is unable?

2 - what can cause this odor?  I've read a few articles that cite the reason as either lightstrike due to improper storage, chemical contamination, or bad yeast.  But, this is above my paygrade to answer.  I can say that we store all the bottles in a medium size, temp controlled wine fridge in our basement.

3 - is this an intended characteristic of the wine?  We've tried a few of the St. Supery Sauvignon Blancs and the Rutherford Estate is the only one that seems to carry this particular nose.

Would love to hear thoughts from you all!

Initially muted on the nose but eventually showed sweet oak, caramel and soy sauce/hoisin. Some sweetness on the attack. Dried figs, dark cherries and blackberries, with pleasant notes of undergrowth and mushroom. Quite advanced for 2018 and reflected the warm vintage. This took about 1.5 hours to come together but when it did, it sang. 94 points

Morey-Saint-Denis 2019

Sweet oak, violets, brambly fruit on the nose. On the palate sour cherries, strawberries, cranberries. Vibrant, zippy acidity with a spicy finish. Exuberant, youthful and beautifully balanced. Oak seamlessly integrated with fruit. Faded a little as the night went on, but so delightful while it lasted. 94 points

Open Your Wine Autumn - September and October roundup,17,1ghf6wl,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1ghf6wl/open_your_wine_autumn_september_and_october/,1,2024-11-02 03:33:43,"Some of you may have read my previous post on this topic, but for those of you just tuning in, Open Your Wine Autumn is a new tradition I have inaugurated which is exactly what it sounds like: A season-long excuse to open any wine that needs an excuse for opening, a yearly cure to the plague of ""waiting for a special occasion"" to crack that nice bottle you're sitting on for no compelling reason. As autumn calls to mind the natural cycles of aging and death, the wise wino, never taking life, health, or time for granted, knows to drink up while they still have the chance. Or, to put things in a slightly more grounded way: I get really bored of only ever opening 'responsible' weeknight bottles ad infinitum when I know I've got more exciting stuff sitting in my fridge, and I want to go a little apeshit for going apeshit's sake from time to time.

To that end I have put my modest amount of money where my mouth is and opened a few of the nicer bottles in my collection since September. I've done this on random weeknights, I've had them with burgers and shawarma and Popeye's and Chinese take-out, and I've consumed every one of them on my living room couch, mostly in pajamas. Since I've got until December 21st to keep #OYWA up I've not yet escalated to the bottles I've been most precious about (stay tuned for the December roundup for those), but I have dusted off the far reaches of my wine fridge and cleared out a good number of lovely bottles which had been waiting patiently for anywhere from 1-3 years for me to get around to drinking them.

In no particular order, here is the most recent batch of the wines I have opened so far this autumn in the spirit of OYWA:

\---

Alessandra Divella Dosaggio Zero Rose de Saignee NV - This stuff was incredible, I love good Franciacorta and having really enjoyed Divella's 'NiNi' at the Four Horsemen a year or two ago I was very excited to find another of her zero-dosage wines at a local shop. I didn't take very detailed notes on this ('strawberry' and 'yeast', ok, very helpful, past me) but with a bit of air on it it went from deceptively simple to absolutely screaming with flavor and aroma that'd make any grand cru grower champagne jealous. Not sure what the hell I meant by ""almost carnal"" but that's in my notes too? Fascinating color, a kind of rusty pinkish sultana raisin hue. World class Franciacorta, will be an insta-buy if I ever come across it again. This stuff begs to be paired with a meal; I think I had mine with fried chicken?

Catherine & Pierre Breton 'Les Perrieres' Bourguiel 2015 - This was a slightly shy Cab Franc that really wanted some time in a decanter to start expressing itself, but an absolute pleasure to drink once it did. Serious depth of flavor with your typical herby-peppery raspberry and earth accord, structured but easy drinking (""digestible"" if you like) at the same time. Had it with a burger and mac salad and could not have asked for a better pairing.

Chateau Simone Palette Rouge 2009 - Had been seeing this gathering dust for ages at a local shop and I'm glad I rescued it. One of those interesting southern French blends, mostly Grenache and Mourvedre with a whole hodgepodge of supporting grapes. Reminded me a bit of a Bordeaux at first with its strong red fruit-mineral-leather thing it had going on, but with sufficient air and warmth it started showing really interesting eucalyptus and licorice and garrigue notes. Really beautiful at 15 years and seemed like it would only get better with more age.

Olivier Horiot ""En Valingrain"" Rose des Riceys 2018 - I had the En Barmont a little earlier this year and loved it, and I liked this one even better. Fascinatingly 'textural' Pinot Noir, it has this kind of mercurial combination of density and lightness I find very hard to put into words; at the risk of getting too silly here it has a certain mysterious, magical energy and otherworldly tension to it. In any case I could drink a pail of the stuff; very tasty strawberry and sour cherry notes, herbaceous, a touch of cedar or pencil shavings. Really cool dark ruby color too, the kind of wine you want to look at with a flashlight. If those red health potions you drink in video games were real, this is what drinking one would feel like.

Domaine de l'Enclos Chablis GC 'Vaudesir' 2020 - One of my favorite white wines I've had all year, the kind of Chardonnay that just puts a smile on my face. I was enjoying myself too much to take detailed notes (I recall lemon, mineral, and smoke) but I did note that it was both serious and deep enough I wanted to take my time with it and also delicious and refreshing enough I wanted to neck a liter of it and ask for seconds.

Domaine de la Chevalerie Grand-Mont Bourguiel 2015 - I enjoyed this, although after having sat on it for nearly 3 years I was left wondering why I waited so long as it didn't really feel all that momentous. (That's the benefit of OYWA, I guess.) Interesting lychee black tea and barnyard notes which I find typical of this kind of low-intervention Loire Cab Franc, a bit of spice, raspberry, leather, plum, a bit of earth. Deep purplish-garnet color. If you've had Chevalerie's other offerings you can imagine a somewhat more structured, ageworthy version of those and you'll know exactly what you're in for with this."

Your favorite Aglianicos,5,1gh7yi1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gh7yi1/your_favorite_aglianicos/,7,2024-11-01 22:23:31,"So I recently got back from a trip to Italy, we were lucky enough to visit Rome and Naples and I made it a point to try some local wines. In my first couple days in Campania I had tried a Taurasi Reserva and another Aglianico and noticed both had a sort of bitter taste or bitter finish that I wasn't enjoying. On a trip out to Amalfi Coast we stopped at Ettori Sammarco, a small winery right on the coast in Ravello. Which I highly recommend stopping in if you're in the area. Very family feel, they have a little tasting counter in the winery and the founder/owner was right there overseeing the work and chatting with us. I believe he is 92 and still involved!I tried some delicious whites and some of their reds and fell in love with their reserve that is 70% Aglianico, 30% Pie de Rosso. It had none of the bitterness and everything I loved about the other wines I had tried. Talking with the host and the owner they mentioned there are multiple types of Aglianicos and the terroir of Ravello is part of why their wines don't have the same bitterness as others. 


I brought some bottles back that I'll sit on for a bit but I'm looking for other recommendations of Aglianicos that don't have that bitter note. As much as I'd love to order direct from Sammarco, ordering by the case with international shipping isn't in my budget at the moment (maybe as a treat down the road). I also get the feeling the other Aglianicos I tried may have been too young and those bitter notes may mellow out of the years. So I'm not opposed to grabbing some bottles to set aside. "

2014 Peju Reserve Cab Franc,44,1gh6b70,https://i.redd.it/f0w8yg1gsayd1.jpeg,10,2024-11-01 21:10:30,"Decanted for about 90 minutes. I donâ€™t drink much Napa, so I was truly shocked at how heavy bodied and just generally BIG this was. I adore Chinon and CFs from Finger Lakes, so this really threw me off at first sip. In my mind CF is thin, light bodied. This could have passed for a zin or MourvÃ¨dre. Bone dry, high, grippy tannins. Light plum and current on the nose. Biggest flavors were leather, tobacco, dry leaves (maybe the Pennsylvania fall affected my taste buds). Each pour I enjoyed more than the previous. A lovely wine, biggest issue was how it tasted against my expectations, but no issues on its own. A nice drinking experience and it was fun to branch out and just enjoy being surprised by something. âœŒðŸ¼"

I'm hosting a Burgundy-themed wine evening tomorrow, and I'm curious as to people's thoughts on whether I should decant the reds.

When I've previously hosted wine evenings, I tend to double-decant the reds a couple of hours beforehand, especially younger reds, to allow them to open up a bit. However, I've got a couple of older wines this time and I'm not certain if I should double decant them. 

Below is my selection of reds from across the CÃ´te de Beaune, CÃ´te Chalonnaise, and CÃ´te de Nuits (in serving order):

* Domaine Denis Carre Bourgogne Hautes CÃ´te de Beaune 2019,
* Moillard Volnay 1er Cru â€˜Les Santenotsâ€™ 2011,
* ChÃ¢teau De Pommard Clos Marey-Monge Monopole 2014,Â 
* Joseph Drouhin Rully 2021,Â

However, balanced and refined â€¦ not as harsh as some 08 can be.
It has your typical Bordeaux feel and taste.

Nose: lots of lees-y, almost champagne-like brioche notes, citrus, and vanilla

Palate: very concentrated, expressive citrus notes (orange peel, lemon), well integrated oak (vanilla, lees characteristics), minerals, very long finish

Beautiful freshness really helps balance out the high alcohol (15%) and oak notes, gives it energy and acidic grip that melts into a long, waxy finish. Not usually a fan of big oaky whites, but that was very moreish.

Guigal ChÃ¢teau d'Ampuis & Bellefont-Belcier Saint-Ã‰milion Grand Cru or a single bottle of  Guigal Ex Voto Ermitage Blanc?

I've been thinking about what to go with (I havenâ€™t had any of them before). Iâ€™m fairly confident about enjoying the reds; Iâ€™ve had Saint-Ã‰milion in a similar price range in the past, and while I liked it, it didnâ€™t leave a lasting impression (so maybe skip? save some money). Iâ€™ve never had a CÃ´te-RÃ´tie, though Iâ€™ve heard excellent things, and I know ChÃ¢teau d'Ampuis has a solid reputation. Iâ€™ve enjoyed Syrah based wines before, so I feel like it could be a good fit.

As for the white, Iâ€™m less familiar with white wines in general but have been intrigued ever since Konstantin Baum introduced the 2012 Ex Voto in one of his videos. The bottle available isnâ€™t a 2012, but Iâ€™m still curious to try it and have high expectations.

Sadly at the moment I don't have any information about vintages, but I expect them to be fairly young ones (towards latest releases if not the latests). It might also be important to mention I don't really plan on aging any of them, might not drink them when they come but soon enough.

So... what do you guys think? What would you go with?"

Review: Belle Glos Clark & Telephone Pinot Noir,98,1ggsgoa,https://i.redd.it/q7t2w7efi6yd1.jpeg,56,2024-11-01 06:47:15,"Soâ€¦this says pinot noir on the bottle, but this does *not* taste like pinot noir. This tastes over-extracted and is syrupy in body/mouthfeel. Dark purple in color, much darker than a pinot noir should be. Needless to say, I can immediately tell this is heavily manipulated like Prisoner and Caymus.

Heavy notes of sweet vanilla, and oak thatâ€™s of an unnatural character. The fruit is a non-distinct mix of mostly dark and some red. I can make out lots of blackberry,  and some cherry and smoke.

This is neither elegant or structured. I would honestly look elsewhere for a quality pinot. It doesnâ€™t even taste that good generally. 

This ainâ€™t it. "

The freshest Aussie Shiraz I've had in recent memory,24,1gg14j2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gg14j2,10,2024-10-31 06:54:21,"Purchased this on a whim as I was drawn to the description of the small wine region that is from: Porongurup - cool sea breezes, high altitude and longer growing seasons.

This was utter deliciously but what impressed me the most was its elegance  and balance. It was not the most complex I've had, but it was able to walk the tightrope of fresh medium bodied Shiraz and still have that depth of flavour and concentration that prevents it from being a thin airy wine with bubblegummy flavours. And this is just their entry wine!

For those who are looking for powerful Aussie Shiraz, this will not be to your liking. But for my palate, I would buy this again and pair it with a multitude of dishes including Cantonese Roasted Pork, Salmon and even a little Schnitzel."

The problem is his study only lasted 5 years and in many of the articles he references the AWRI (but the AWRI says wine should be stored horizontally)

  
[https://www.awri.com.au/industry\_support/winemaking\_resources/storage-and-packaging/post-packaging/transport-and-storage/](https://www.awri.com.au/industry_support/winemaking_resources/storage-and-packaging/post-packaging/transport-and-storage/)

He claims that after a 5 year research project that corks will last almost indefinitely in the upright position.

Obviously that does not make sense as real life wine collectors know all to well the issues with dried up corks.

Does anybody know of any other research proving him right or wrong?

I just turned 21 the other day and to mark my ability to legally purchase a bottle of wine I plan on buying a nice bottle of Bordeaux. I have done a ton of research over the past few months about wine, especially Bordeaux. I'm also pretty familiar with wine because my dad is in the wine business. If I'm being honest though, I'm just starting to appreciate wine, and I don't quite know yet what my personal preferences are. With that being said I want to buy a bottle of Bordeaux to start my cellar with. I narrowed my search down to 2 wines 2020 Figeac or 2020 Chateau Ducru-Beaucaillou. If I am going with rankings, WA gave the Figeac 100 points (My dad says WA is the best ranking followed by WS). On the other hand, I think the Ducru Beaucaillou is a little more elegant which I think is more my style(I just don't know yet for sure though). Another major criteria I have is which wine will be ready first. I would like to drink these wines within the decade. Does anyone have any thoughts? I do plan on buying a few other cheaper wines to get started but I wanted a nice bottle to store. Sorry for the long post I just don't know what direction I should go.

I donâ€™t think traditional tasting notes work for these wines, Iâ€™d have to tell you about the wildly high volatile acidity on the red and the almost too much texture on the white and we would fixate on that and never get to the important part. 

These are emotional wines, thereâ€™s not many producers that can make you feel as much in a wine as Kenjiro does, that doesnâ€™t mean the wines are easy by any means, I think most people would be surprised and probably not understand if they saw just how much VA is in the wines but then you taste them and the only reaction is to smile.

It seems like, recently, most wine regions have been improving in quality, with better modern winemaking and viticulture techniques (not to mention climate change improving growing conditions in some places).

I have roughly 40 bottles of wine, nothing insanely valuable, but some gems from Heitz, Dunn, etc from 2012-14.

My fiancÃ© and I moved out of Denver this summer and left the wine in thermal fridge tote bags underneath a friends bed where itâ€™s roughly 69-71Â° in perpetuity and in the dark. We moved to Austin, and the moving company wouldnâ€™t take the wine. 

1) what damage is being done to the wine at that temperature? Itâ€™s been there three months. It is a mix of Pinot Noir and Cab Sauv
2) what is the most economical and safe way to get the wine to Texas?

The whole collection might be worth $5,000-7,000 - I am not really interested in high-end wine shipping, but I donâ€™t want to fly up to Colorado and rent a car to bring it down to Texas. I am considering securely packing it up and checking it on a United flight across 3-4 boxes. I am confident that a â€œfragileâ€ sticker and proper packing would ensure its safety on the plane to about 99%. I could also just tough it out and rent a car one-way and make the drive, costing me probably $600 in plane, gas, and car rental.

We drank one bottle later in our vacation in San Francisco, and brought some others home to the east coast. 

All these years later, we still had one bottle of that Late Harvest Symphony hanging around. After so many years, we assumed it had gone bad, but didnâ€™t want to toss it out, but also never had the desire to open it. 

Until tonight. 

Neighbors came over to celebrate my husbandâ€™s birthday, brought dessert, and I suggested this as the night we open the very old wine. And it wasâ€¦.

Not as bad as we expected! Not as good as we remembered, but it was drinkable. 

Still had faint traces of the apricot, peach, and pear we remembered. Lost the florals. Had some port-like notes. Not terrible for a 24-year old wine! Hats off to the winemaker. ðŸŽ©

"Self-afflicted psychological allergy of alcohol, possible?",0,1gdxicf,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gdxicf/selfafflicted_psychological_allergy_of_alcohol/,8,2024-10-28 15:59:37,"If this is not the subreddit for this, then I am sorry and this can be transferred/deleted. I only visit this subreddit and donâ€™t really know where else to post this, and this is something I am really struggling with.

Â 

I come from an environment where drinking is considered normal. This goes for not just my family, but basically everyone I grew up with. Parents of friends down the street, social gatherings like birthdays, diner parties. Ever since I was a kid, almost all the adults in my life drank alcohol. A considerable portion of the friends I have now, also like to drink. Not all are heavy drinkers, but if I am being honest it feels like I am verging on the edge of alcoholism myself and I know for a fact both my parents are and have been alcoholics for a long time.

Â 

What â€˜kept me in the darkâ€™ for a long time is that no-one around me really seemed to be compromised in their daily lives because of this life-style. Functioning addicts (not all of them, but still), so to speak. If I am being honest (again) I also donâ€™t see the problem in drinking whatever amount if itâ€™s someoneâ€™s choice and it doesnâ€™t come with harmful consequences for that person or his/her surroundings.

Â 

However, someone really close to me has developed a condition which really has damaged the way I view this person, and at time makes me want to cut him/her out of my life for good. Thus, the reason of this post.

Â 

Is it possible for some-one who has been drinking all his/her life to develop a sort of allergy of alcohol?

Â 

The person I am referring to may be having a pleasant conversation with you, but as soon as the first glass of wine is consumed things take a turn. The visual aspects of someone who is completely drunk are recognizable immediately (which is â€˜too soonâ€™) but even worse, the personâ€™s whole character seems to change. The same anecdotes are told back to back. Mean verbal jabs are made. His or her opinion on things are really extreme, but seem to be completely random, like the real â€˜he or sheâ€™ is completely gone.

Â 

It's just like the tolerance is completely gone, and a sort of super random auto-pilot takes over. I know it sounds like I am describing someone who is black-out drunk but like I said, this occurs after just one glass of wine, and this person has been drinking all his/her life. Can you drink away your tolerance to the point you are just a completely different person?"

How do I get into learning about red wine?,1,1gduusy,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gduusy/how_do_i_get_into_learning_about_red_wine/,9,2024-10-28 12:32:26,"Hello wine community.
Over the last year or so, Iâ€™ve really gotten into liking wines, reading about them and tasting them - but only whites. Mainly because I prefer whites, but also because I have an easier time distinguishing notes and differentiating the wines. I especially find Rieslings interesting, as the wines are incredibly versatile (I love crisp Riesling from Mosel, especially ones only harvested and made 1-2 years ago). NZ Sauvignons are also a favorite of mine (I prefer crisp, acidic, fruity and dry whites.) 

But reds just seem so much more difficult and hard to grasp? Where do I start? What grapes/areas? Also the notes and palates - for some reason I just do not find it as easy as smelling/tasting them on whites. How do I get going? 

I do drink reds - and like them - but the knowledge is very basic (I know I like Pinots). 

What would your tip be? How do I get good at reds. Thanks! ðŸ·"

Rocks district Syrah recommendations ,12,1gdsbqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gdsbqq/rocks_district_syrah_recommendations/,31,2024-10-28 09:55:33,"I recently had a couple bottles of Syrah from walla walla. The first was the base walla walla Syrah from Gramercy Cellars and the other was The Unnamed Series 2019 Syrah. I found both of these wines to be absolutely mind blowing. I am relatively new to wine and havenâ€™t developed great vocabulary for what I am tasting, but I loved how â€˜crispâ€™ the Gramercy Cellars was but still had a depth of darker fruit almost savory taste was. The Unnamed Series was great because it felt like over the course of the evening like I was drinking 3 separate wines. When I first opened it it had the same crispness I liked in the Gramercy bottle, but then changed to an almost smoky flavor. After about another hour the smoke gave way to a really delicious funky fruity wine. Really great stuff. 

All of this has made me extremely curious about other Walla Walla producers. My first question is: in my researching these bottles I have noticed people say rocks Syrah has a distinct funk. I am assuming thatâ€™s what I liked in the second bottle. Do other grapes besides Syrah exhibit this funky flavor from Rocks producers? My second question is i am looking for recommendations for wines similar to the ones i described. When I was trying to dig up different producers I ran across Cayuse and Reynvaan, both seem hard to find and expensive. I have also seen K Vintners and Rotie recommended, but not sure which make wines closer in style to those I have already enjoyed. I want to buy a half case direct from a winery that average out to about $50-60/bottle, but Iâ€™m not sure which to choose. Any help would be appreciated! "

I decided not to decant so I could watch the evolution a few ounces at a time. Immediately this gushed with vivid notes of blue fruitsâ€¦ think cocoa dusted blueberries & sappy cassis. With some air and time it began to reach equilibrium with notes of spice, glimpses of wet soil, loam, espresso grinds & milk chocolate. The structure was quite robust but completely velvety, this was gorgeous but the absolute icing on the cake came at the 2 hour mark when it really started to show a Rocky minerality & distinct notes of sea salt (think salted chocolate). Absolutely fabulous with a long, delicious life ahead.

V12 Cabernet,5,1gdoe0a,https://i.redd.it/mxq2m4t3wdxd1.jpeg,1,2024-10-28 06:32:15,"


2018 V12 Cabernet Sauvignon

Pulled and poured

Super rich jam, tobacco and a bit of dustiness on the nose initially, florals breaking through after 30-45 minutes in the glass

On the palate itâ€™s a bit muted to start, thereâ€™s some blackberry, tart cherries and some vanilla. Tannins are polished, plenty of acid here (probably from the hillside elevations of the vineyard) but not overwhelming, finish is long with toasty oak and spices, paired well with some Japanese bbq marinated flap loin cooked on the grill."

Cork was perfect, popped and poured but waited 15 mins - evolved in the bottle all evening. Still singing at 25 years- nose was floral, earthy and got some cherry and blackberry, minerals fading and finish not very long. But elegant and composed after so long for a Bourgogne. Says everything about the producer. 

With spicy Indian food you say, how inappropriate. This was only used during early appetizers, and have to say the spices counterintuitively did not overwhelm the wines. 

Confirmed yet again, Burgundy is all about the producer. I recall buying a case of this at under $50 a bottle long ago. Just a couple left, was worried its past its prime but definitely not so. "

Almost whenever I mention that I like Riesling, people say it is â€œtoo sweetâ€, even if I specify â€œdry Rieslingâ€. I understand if you donâ€™t like specific sweet varieties of wine like dessert wines or semi-sweet reds or whites, but every Riesling Iâ€™ve ever had was dry, and it seems most available are dry. 

I thought this was just an American thing that by imports/marketing Riesling has a reputation of being â€œsweetâ€. But even in Europe, people also seem to have this perspective in my experience.

Why is Riesling catching flak as â€œtoo sweetâ€ of a wine when there are many actually sweet wine varieties that donâ€™t seem to receive the same criticism?"

So fresh and precise still this could go longer easily.

Triolet 2020 - Less salinity and complexity, this was a challenging vintage. Similar lemon and lime but also a little grassy yet a little brighter than the 2015. Citrus galore on the palate, however feels thinner and less complex. 

Triolet 2022 - The standout for the Triolet here, this one is so well integrated. Has complexity beyond the 2015 and also tastes older than the 2015. Zippy yet creamy and well balanced. 2022 is a great vintage.

Chardonnay 2020 - Buttery and rich on the nose, refreshing salinity and yellow fruits. Still great complexity for this challenging year. 

Chardonnay 2021 - Like the 2020 but more fresh, more acidity and more fruit forward. A buffed up version of the 2020.

Chardonnay 2022 - Okay so what a vintage for the whites this is, so complex and drinking well beyond its years. This is a standout and so well integrated already, this would be exciting to revisit in 10 years. 

Marli Russell 2021 - A new endeavour by Mount Mary focusing on Rhone varieties grown and vinified at the estate. Big red fruit nose, core of strawberry and jam, smells like a farmers market. The palate is light and fresh with strawberry, cranberry, light as a feather, wow! Young Grenache vines so itâ€™s less concentrated fruit and lacks the earthiness you expect from a GSM. 

Marli Russell 2022 - This one has darker fruits, jammy plum and boysenberry, very brooding on the nose. Palate similar to the 2021 but more concentrated fruits. 

Pinot Noir 2021 - Very excited, my favourite Australian Pinot, feels like its weightless on the nose, dark red fruit core, porcelain on the palate itâ€™s so delicate, floats effortlessly with a trio of strawberry, slight pepper and vanilla pods.

Quintet 2014 - Deep and concentrated, blackcurrant and boysenberry with dried vanilla pods. Dark and ripe red fruits converging on a medium body. 10 years on and could still go a long way! 

Quintet 2017 - More liquorice and pronounced red fruits compared to the 2014, I get a little eucalyptus too. This one could almost fool me as Margaret River in a blind tasting. 

Quintet 2021 - Lost the eucalyptus note entirely, more earthy with deep red fruits with much more concentration. Excellent balance, great oak and vanilla perfectly integrated.

Quintet 2022 - More vanilla pronounced, thinner body on the palate but fresh and vibrant still with ripe red fruits."

In the privileged position of being a semi-retired physician with time including for travel, and have some capital. I would become a wine ""professional"" just to do this. I'm banned by my luckily more-sensible wife from starting or investing in a hobby winery so what else could I do to work or contribute to the wine world? I currently help a friend in her warehouse winery as needed but it needs to be a real role (i.e. 20+ hours a week). I'm in Australia.

It doesn't have to make money. I doubt the world needs more amateur wine writers. Ideas I've had... I could go in as an investor if a friend with industry experience starts a wine bar. Non profit? I have lots of contacts in the Middle East and could do something somehow helping winemakers in marginal areas?? Doing boutique imports is probably the easiest to initiate from a mechanical point of view but sounds capital-intensive, low and possibly negative margin and generally a pain in the ass unless I actually tried to scale it up. Would involve tax-deductible travel and probably good home drinking in direct proportion to sales failure but I'm under no illusions as to the glamour (my father shipped industrial material around the world and it seemed very painful).

Any ideas?

Paired well with spicy vegetarian nachos.

We are both fairly new to wine and haven't delved too much into the Old World. We loved how much we learned about the process and grew a much deeper love and respect for wine. 

The 1993 Vouvray, we only bought because that is our birth year and it was only 6â‚¬. It was the oldest white that I have had and it was a lot in the mouth. Tasted like I took a mouth full of dirt and chased it with some mushroom water. Definitely wasn't a favorite. 

We weren't in Bordeaux long, only 2 and a half days and only got one wine tour in at St. Emillion. I wish we would have been able to spend more time in this area as there was more things to see and wine to try than we had time for. 

This is the haul that we came home with. Our main goal was to get a bottle with the intention to save it for our 15 year anniversary. We chose the 2020 Chateau Martet. We loved this wine when we tried it at the shop. Had the tasting notes of dark cherry, vanilla, and licorice.

As an example I recently bought 3 cases of Chateau Teyssier (Montagne St Emilion) 2019, at a cost of EUR12/bottle which I expect will improve over the next 5 years. 

I've previously dabbled with home-brewing beer, and ""made"" a temperature controlled fermentation chambre using a tried and tested DIY approach: a fridge, with a small 60W tubular electric heater placed inside, the fridge and heater both wired into a thermostatic controller which turns one or the other on to maintain the temp within a set range. For home-brew this was around 19-21 degrees C, but it would be easy to adjust this to say 12-15 degrees C.

I'm wondering if something like this would work rather than spending Â£100's on a purpose-build wine fridge (esp. given the type/value of wine I'd be storing).

New to wine in general, brought back two bottles of champagne from a recent trip I was hoping to store for five years. Can I just vacuum seal the entire sealed champagne bottle and shove it in a normal fridge? I was reading that normal fridges get too dry which is bad for the cork and keeping the storage trouble free. I was thinking that by vacuum sealing the entire bottle it would keep humidity steady even in a normal fridge. The other solution I thought of was maybe wax dipping the top of the bottle which I would think would make it a more consistent humidity level.

I know nothing, y'all know a lot. Please help a brother out if you have a minute. I did try searching around in the sub but the closest I found to an answer was talking about slowing/stopping the aging of the wine using a vacuum bag, which is not what I'm looking to do. I'm just trying to safely store it. I like in a pretty temperate climate, but our house will see some days in the 50s and some days in the high 80s and I don't have a basement."

First time trying old wine (Lafite 1988),140,1gckn96,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gckn96,40,2024-10-26 20:05:04,"Tried 3 different vintages of Lafite during the Decanter Masterclass in Singapore. 

2018 was very tight and tannic with primary fruits dominating both the aroma and palette. Can see how the wine will be elegant and great in the future. 

2008 was more advanced but still had great structure and started to show more softness but still had the primary fruit core. 

1988 was the one that made me go â€˜what the hell!?!?â€™ The first sniff I took almost made me gag. The barnyard funk was so strong that I thought I put my head into a pail of horse shit. Honestly, Iâ€™m not sure if this is representative of what older Bordeaux wines taste like. But it was quite revolting. The speaker remarked that we have to look past the barnyard funk to see the underlying tertiary notes. At this point, I was seriously questioning if the wine was corked or spoilt but it was my first time trying a 30+ yo wine and everyone around me didnâ€™t say anything so I didnâ€™t want to raise any questions lol. 

For those of you whoâ€™ve tried this vintage in recent years or have had experience with much older Bordeaux reds, is it common to have such a strong barnyard funk (smelling like horse shit)? Personally I didnâ€™t find it enjoyable so idk maybe itâ€™ll be something I have to experience more to appreciate. "

Just wanted to share a few pics of the Port Capital of the World: Duoro. This place really needs to be seen to believed. The slopes that hold the port grape are steep and rock solid. Slate and Shist rock battle for the grape vines of Pedro Xemenez and many other varietals. The people of the Duoro are lovely, hard working, life long devotees of their task, climbing these rocky slopes with wine baskets to harvest these grapes. 

After touring most of the wineries, my favorites are Sandemans and Dow, but other smaller, less well-known producers are also fantastic. 

I cook with 10 year tawny (pork with red wine vinegar, safe and port are my go-to) and drink 20 and 30 year tawny. 

If you love Port, make it a point to visit this beautiful region. It's well worth the long drive, side of the road, precipice gazing at the vertical slopes and amazing cellars of these vineyards. Cheers!

Ideal Wine Cellar Inventory According to Little's Law,25,1gcbvpu,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gcbvpu/ideal_wine_cellar_inventory_according_to_littles/,13,2024-10-26 10:13:37,"Little's law is a quick way to determine the optimal number of widgets in a process, whether it is a part in a manufacturing process, or a bottle in a wine cellar. 

The law says that the number of inventory items during steady state is equal to the average processing time (holding period) multiplied by the consumption rate.

Steady Inventory = Holding Period X Consumption Rate

For example. If I consume 52 bottles of wine per year, and I want to cellar each bottle for an average of 5 years, my ideal cellar inventory is 52x5=260.

More than 260 bottles means I won't consume enough before they age out, less than 260 means I'm consuming more than what my target holding period will allow. 

It's a simple way to perform a gut check for the ""how much is too much?"" question regarding how much wine to buy and cellar. "
The Wine List at Core by Clare Smyth seems a bit confused about Australia ,34,1gcbjf9,https://i.redd.it/b1ry6rp3m0xd1.jpeg,20,2024-10-26 09:53:01,"This map of Australia on page 65 of the wine list from 3-Michelin Star â€˜Core by Clare Smythâ€™ has bemused me for ages.

Besides putting Perth about 900km too far north, the map of Western Australia seems to think an area of mostly arid desert around the size of Italy is all wine-country (if only!). 

I sent an email about this years ago but - despite numerous revisions to the list - the map remains unchanged, and so does my minor irritation.

Still, always good to have Margaret River and The Great Southern represented on such a brilliant list!"

It lifted the oily/fishiness of the bonito. Might have clashed with the sweetness of the onion but otherwise an ideal pairing.

K&L left me a voicemail informing me they have refunded me in full. 

I was really happy to learn recently that K&L had a shipping affiliate that shipped to other states than CA. They're called RareStorage and the shipping rates seemed really reasonable. I filled up a couple cases of wine, paid for shipping and insurance and since then it has been a nightmare. 

They shipped my wine through GLS, who proceeded to drop my wine off in a different state than the one I live in. Now, nobody seems to know where it is, or when it will get to my house. K&L can't really help, although they have tried and their customer service is excellent, but RareStorage is a separate company. RareStorage won't talk to you on the phone and so you rely on email correspondence. They provided me with a new tracking number yesterday that was incorrect which further complicated things. I contacted GLS, who has assured me twice now that their operations team will contact me. That hasn't happened.

To K&Ls credit, they have really tried to help, but it seems their hands are tied. It also sounds like RareStorage uses different shipping companies for different states, so you could get lucky and have your wines shipped via UPS or Fed-Ex depending on your location. If you're considering having wines shipped through RareStorage, I would first inquire about which shipping company they'll use to get the wines to you. Also - for my state, there was not an overnight or 2 day shipping option. That probably should have raised red flags in itself, but by the time I realized that, it was too late. 

I know plenty of people here have had good experiences with K&L, and this really isn't their fault. But I did want to give the community a heads up that their affiliate is less commendable and your mileage may vary, depending on where you live. "

This beauty comes from the Eisenberg region of the southern Burgenland. Wachter-Wiesler are a well established producer from there, making BlaufrÃ¤nkisch in a terroir-driven style that focuses on refinement and freshness. The wine hails from the Weinberg vineyard in the village of Deutsch-SchÃ¼tzen. It has a souther exposition and its soil consists of iron rich clay. After spontaneous fermentation and spent 34 months in a large oak casks.

I aerated the wine for about 1 1/2 hours after opening and served it in a Spiegelau Definition Bordeaux glass. It has an opaque ruby colour and garnet rim.

On the nose the wine presents itself with dark fruity aromas at first, think of luxardo cherry, sloe and plum. Soon after, more savoury notes take control, hallmark notes of Eisenberg BlaufrÃ¤nkisch like blood and iodine come through immediately. The wine then also presents notes of crushed stones, undergrowth and black pepper. Furthermore, a well integrated hint of barnyard funk, citrus and earth envelope the wine.

The palate shows intense fruit of sloe and dark cherry at first, minerality and earthy notes come through as well. A very fresh acidity and structured, but not overpowering tannins add structure. A long finish brings the wine to an end, showing notes of luxardo cherry, meat juices, leather and herbal tones.

Another Eisenberg-banger after the Weninger Saybritz for me! It shows a perfect interplay of fruity, savoury and lightly spicy notes at this point of development. It also has still a lot of life still in it, so extended aging would also be an option. If you enjoy BlaufrÃ¤nkisch of this style, definitely give it a try!"

94-95 points

NOTE: after tasting through everything in this wild lineup, the value/QPR of Clerc Milon really stood out to me!! I wish I took more detailed notes on this.

Ch d Armailhac 2015
soft nose, but not extremely expressive. fruit was there but a bit one dimensional. long lasting finish. 93 pts

Petit Mouton 2010
dark color, but the garnet is starting to appear on the edges
nose not as pronounced but came out a bit - likely just needed to open up
palate was fantastic. black cherry, dark fruit, slight graphite, vanilla,  tannis were present and a bit grippy. meaty and vanilla finish. this wine is about to enter its prime, if it isnâ€™t already. finish was long and enjoyable. 
95-96 pts


Mouton Rothschild 2009
color: still dark but the tawny look around the edges
nose: pronounced, black currant, dark and lightly stewed fruits
mouth: extremely silky, balanced, slightly warm, pronounced cherry, fresh vanilla, looong finish - creme brulee, vanilla, cherry. lasted 10 minutes if not longer

the finish specifically developed in my mouth - i wish we decanted!
97 pts - but i think if this was decanted it would reach 98

Mouton Rothschild 2005
dark and tawny color
nose: stewed fruit, some vanilla, toasted nuts
palate: fresh fruit on the edge of the palate that morphs into a somewhat stewed fruit on the center of the palate. still a good structure - this wine is in its early prime (for my palate) tannins are present and silky, but  leaves a grip that wants me wanting so much more.

97 pts - also probably needed a decant


Personally, â€˜09>â€™05, but they were both excellent.


Chateau Coutet Sauternes-Barsac 2008
nose: pear, citrus, ginger which allows the flavor to pierce through the nose
palate: the candied ginger is so awesome on this. it has all your classic sauternes notes, but the way the ginger makes this so unique has me really happy with this.
95 pts.

New Somm,2,1gbx4yx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gbx4yx/new_somm/,27,2024-10-25 22:36:20,"Hi all,

I'm looking for tips, tricks and/or tactics for remembering wine details. 

I have just started as a somm and am finding that it is difficult to get all the details locked down for the wines. I am expected to remember the winemaking and tasting notes for all of the BTG and Pairing wines but I keep getting things mixed up or just can't seem to lock it into memory.

 For example, Elk Cove Pinot Noir comes from 6 sites that are fermented separately in stainless steel and blended then matured in French oak for 10 months, using Pommard and Dijon clones. Then I'll have Hartford Court Chardonnay from Russian River Valley in Sanoma that is barrel fermented with 28% new French oak and aged for 9.5 months with weekly lees string and goes through full malolactic conversion. 

  
Two very different wines, made in very different ways but when I have to remember those details for 20, 30, 40 plus wines I find that I get aging times mixed up or the blend mixed up and so on, especially if the wines are similar. 

  
Wondering if anyone out there has ideas for how to get these things memorized. Event if its seems simple, I am just trying to pool different ideas I could adopt. 

  
Cheers 

From a Baby Somm"

Thereâ€™s this trio of olive-cranberry-cured meats that immediately hits my tongue and creates this savoury yet sweet tapestry. The back end is supported by this delicious mocha and leather tertiary notes which complement the primaries hugely. This tastes like a charcuterie board with some strawberry quince.

Casanova di Neri & Tenuta Il Poggione were decanted for 2.5 hours before drinking and the Le ragnaie was poured out in the glass and we started drinking it after 45 mins .

to me the winner among these wines tonight is definitely the casanova di neri , come close at second place , le ragnaie 2019 which did not opened up as I hope during the night 

on the nose the 2018 casanova di neri is simply beautiful ,notes : plum , cherry , oaky , chocolate , tobacco , spice  , tannins are very well integrated .

ended the night with a bottle of Tokaji i brought back from my trip to Budapest , sold by Faust Wine Cellar . I have not tasted alot of tokaji or dessert wine , but this bottle is absolutely delightful to be paired with the pandan swissroll . perfect ending to the night

* Preference for blends over single varietal
* Aged whites are worth looking into for more interesting
* If it's some weird (not popular) grape variety, it's worth a shot
* I usually limit my regions and countries so I don't have too many variables so I can know what to expect a little more flavor wise - as regions within countries can be so different (like South Africa)
* Usually my budget is $20-35
* Avoid Cab Sav and Pinot Noir (cause under $30 is risky) - too many other reds to pick from

But seriously, has anyone else feeling like there's been a huge increase in noticeably whole cluster fermented/stem included pinot noirs lately? I know it's not a new technique by any means, but in my memory it used to be something that added an extra je ne sais quoi to a vintage that maybe needed some help with complexity, not hit you over the palate stem-y chewy. If the first thing I notice when tasting a pinot is if it's had stem contact or not, IMO it's gone too far. Specifically on American pinots, which I get a fairly broad exposure to through work, feels like recently the volume has been turned up to 11. Maybe my palate is just super sensitive to it and no one else is noticing this trend. Do I need to start a ABSCP (anything but stem contact pinot) club to join the ABC club?"

Despite my being able to find no flaw - everything was in balance, the tannins were pleasant, acid was appropriate, and they made no mistakes such as being too fruit-forward or having a weird finish - this wine made me bored. 

What can I tell you about its character? Nothing, I could not detect any. The nose? Your basic Bordeaux nose, albeit in more restrained intensity than I expected.

Decanted for about half an hour and then drunk over the next hour, it might have opened up given more time but it didn't ""feel"" like a tight wine waiting to uncoil.

An enticing pale ruby colour. The nose is very aromatic with fruit cake, dried figs, cherry, and olive brine supported by an earthiness with some mushroom and lager.  

A light body with some light acidity right out the bottle complimented by very fine chalky tannins which dissipate over the second pour. Immediately getting sour cherries with strawberries and red currants. The secondary earthiness is also present with that great mushroom and cured meat which gives it that classic French savoury feel. Dark red fruits emerge with some air and are persistent through the finish. 

This is delicious, I fuck with Bandol, especially this cuvÃ©e."

My Mt. Etna experience and the regionâ€™s parallels with Burgundy,182,1gateoa,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gateoa,35,2024-10-24 10:31:16,"I just got back from Sicily for my honeymoon, and as part of the trip that I got to plan we visited two wineries: Benanti and Girolamo Russo. Both had fantastic wines with great tour guides/somms that took you through a flight of 5 or 6 of their wines. What made the latter visit extra special however was getting to experience some of the harvest of their Nerello Mascalese grapes. 
As you might know, things go a little differently in Europe and you canâ€™t just stop by unannounced at the tasting room, you need to email them and reserve a time slot for a good 2-3 hr or longer experience likely to be paired with multiple courses and/or walks through the vineyard. 
Benantiâ€™s wines and historic production house turned modern showcase are impressive, with a large old wooden press and art adorning the rooms that had a sort of royal, medieval vibe to them, only surrounded by lava rocks. We tasted a beautiful sparkling metodo classico brut Rosato (that they no longer make or at least sell and distribute past 2020), a contrada bianco, a 10 yr old Nerello Cappuccio, and 2 more reds including a 2011 Serra Della Contessa, probably their most prized vineyard boasting centenarian vines behind the property on the side of a SE facing hill. This was all paired with thoughtfully paired food courses for each person. We didnt have the Pietra Marina, but I left with two 2019s after reading and hearing first hand how ageworthy it is.
Girolamo Russo is a newer winery with their own unique story that I wonâ€™t get into here, but the tour was incredibly special. The woman leading our experience let us work the sortable table before taking us through each of their main vineyards by having us follow in our rental car within the different contrade, or sub zones. We eventually walked up to their current tasting room if you can call it that, for their entire lineup including a metodo classico and pet-nat I didnâ€™t know they made. All these wines were just as impressive, each having their own character depending on the contrada they represented. 

After touring the vineyards I remember being struck by all parallels to Burgundy: the lava rock walls surrounding all the vineyards, much like a clos; thereâ€™s many different producers working in the same contrada, and Mt Etnaâ€™s wines are extremely elegant and mineral, with red and white expressions made from mostly single varietal grapes (especially the higher end bottles). I even remember thinking I could totally mistake Girolamo Russoâ€™s San Lorenzo Bianco for a high quality 1er cru Chablis. When I mentioned some of this to our somm she replied, â€œyou know they call it the Burgundy of the South!â€ She wasnâ€™t kiddingâ€”after looking back at the World Atlas of Wine, Jancis Robertson says â€œSome see it as the new CÃ´te dâ€™Or, and vine holdings are similarly parcellated.â€ 
Thereâ€™s a lot incredible wine there, with many relatively newer wineries tending some diverse and exciting terroir. And if you love bubbles, especially rose, thereâ€™s amazing QPR to be had there too! Vintage bottles of metodo classico brut rosato aged on its lees for 2-3 years can be found everywhere in shops for â‚¬25-30"

Poggio di Sotto Brunello di Montalcino 2017

Decanted and drank over two hours. 

My first experience with this legendary Brunello producer and it did not disappoint.

2017 has an unfair rep as a ""bad"" vintage, but I think 2017 Brunello from good producer is still good Brunello and, very importantly, pretty ready to drink now. This isn't for aging over decades (save that for the 2016s and 2019s).

Initially pretty tannic, but with air, really opened up.

Notes of red cherry, red plum, chestnut, soil. Over time, the fruit notes came to the forefront.

Really lovely wine that could benefit from further aging, but is already approachable.

93 points.

Daniel Rion & Fils Vosne-Romanee Les Chaumes 1er Cru 2017

Ready to drink now. Needs a little air, but not heavy decanting (although I did decant it).

Very fruit-forward Bourgogne, ripe fruit, bright cherry notes. 

Nose is almost perfumey with floral notes of rose and cherry blossom. Almost reminds me of my wife's perfume. 

Drinking lovely now.

Very fun experience and would drink both again any day of the week! "

Explosion of red berries on the nose. Like a smoothy of raspberries that is deliciously inviting. Background notes of sagebrush and dessert shrubs but really the raspberries stole all my attention.

On the palate, you immediately think bright red fruits that give a full mouth feel but without making you exhausted with it being a typical CA red wine. It was bright and lovely and balance with a nice acidity. The finsih went on for days, like a treat.

Overall it's a classy example of Anderson Valley pinot noir. Really love to drink on its own but I snacked on some charcuterie and truffle cheese, which was perfect.

94/100. I regret I didn't pick up a second bottle. 

Hard not to smile while drinking and Anderson Valley pinot and this had me ear to ear.

Are Vinotemp wine fridges still considered a good budget pick?,5,1gamejh,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gamejh/are_vinotemp_wine_fridges_still_considered_a_good/,7,2024-10-24 04:49:28,"I saw this 157-bottle Vinotemp for sale at Lowe's for just $630 - nothing seems to be even close to that price for a similar capacity. I'd heard some reports of failure after a couple years in general for this brand, but I'd think any brand besides Eurocaves carries that risk - if it lasts even 6-8 years I'd consider it a win for this price. The side-loading bottle layout could also be problematic for some bottle sizes, but even staggering bottles the capacity should be sufficient for the price.

I'm from Germany, specifically from the Riesling region, where wine is a big part of the culture. Funny enough, I noticed pretty early on that I can't really handle wine. Where Iâ€™m from, itâ€™s common to mix white wine with water to make a refreshing spritzer, so I didn't think much about it growing up since it was always diluted.

As I got older, I moved away from white wine and started trying red wines, but soon switched almost entirely to beer after spending some time in Bavaria. Now Iâ€™ve realized that whenever I have just one glass of wine, it gives me stomachaches and gastrointestinal issues that last through the next day. At first, I thought maybe it was an alcohol thing, but I can drink two liters of beer without any problems.

Has anyone else experienced this? Could there be something specific in wine that causes these issues? Or is it possible that beer, with its anti-inflammatory compounds, helps counteract the effects of alcohol on my stomach?

Any insights would be appreciated!

Based in the UK if that makes any difference - assume I know nothing about champagne (I know nothing). Thanks!

A charming wine the leaves you very happy sip after sip, after sniff. Gorgeous lift and ethereal aromatics (med+), red, sappy and high toned fruits coalesce with spice and minerality from the terroir for a great stem to glass representation.  The palate is medium bodied with med+ flavor density.  Med+ fresh finish.  Really great into to what the Pataille wines are like. Decant for 2 hours."

I have a question that I hope you can help me with. I recently received my allocation of Sea Smoke, and UPS left 2 boxes, each with one Magnum, on my porch in the sun in 85 degree weather. I contacted Sea Smoke customer service and they said the wine would be fine, which seems off to me. 6 or so hours at 85 degrees? That doesn't seem like it could be good for the wine.

I probably won't open them for several years. Are my wines going to be cooked?"

- 2021 RaventÃ³s i Blanc ""Blanc de Blancs"" [Catalunya]: ""Not-technically-Cava"" that tastes like Champagne. High acid, maybe a bit bready/yeasty, refreshing, and with a lot of pleasant bubbles.

- 2019 Ossian ""Quintaluna"" Verdejo [Segovia]: Sweet-ish, tropical fruits, round and soft on the palate. Made from 100+ year old, pre-phylloxera vines with a bit of oak.

- 2021 Leirana ""Finca Genoveva"" AlbariÃ±o [Rias Baixas]: Very high acid, fruity (lemon-lime). Sharp, with a bit of sea salt in the finish. Vines planted in 1862.

- 2021 Emilio Moro ""El Zarzal"" Godello [Bierzo]: Yellow fruits and high acid, but less than the AlbariÃ±o. Rich and hints of sweetness. Aged on lees and in French oak.

- 2012 R. LÃ³pez de Heredia ""ViÃ±a Tondonia"" Reserva - [Rioja]: Leather, baking spice, coconut, hints of herbs, and tons of red fruits (strawberry) that have been lightly cooked or macerated. Oaky, medium and round tannins.

- 2019 Bodegas AliÃ³n [Ribera del Duero]: Lots of oak, high tannins that are less fine than the previous wine. Stewed dark fruits, some baking spices sprinkled in.

- 2021 Ãlvaro Palacios ""Les Terrases"" Vinyes Velles [Priorat]: Vanilla blueberry pastry. Medium to light body, medium acid, some oakiness.

- 2021 RaÃºl PÃ©rez ""Las GundiÃ±as"" [Bierzo]: High acid, some fruit (cranberries), a bit of woodiness. Overall pleasant.

- 2021 Bodegas Bernabeleva ""Navaherreros"" Garnacha [Sierra de Gredos]: Very light and bright red color. Good acid, active tannins, ripe fruit. Natty wine with some fun funkiness.

While these were all tasty, quality wines, my favorites were the LÃ³pez de Heredia ""ViÃ±a Tondonia"" and the Leirana ""Finca Genoveva"", with the Emilio Moro ""El Zarzal"" as best of the rest. RaÃºl PÃ©rez and Bernabeleva were weird but in a very good way, while AliÃ³n was too tannic for me."

Recs for wine shops with vintages is also appreciated.

I recently went on a trip to Tuscany Italy, and I was never really a wine drinker. There however, I saw myself faced with some nice local wines and I was a little bit sad, because I couldn't tell in what way these wines were special or characteristic. Thats when I did some google searching on wine tasting and the next dinner I prepared the wines ""profile?"" (sweetness, acidity, tannin,alcohol, body) and we all took turns guessing these characteristics. That was surprisingly fun and now back home (germany) I want to prepare a little wine tasting session. We are all STEM graduates and like experimentation, which is why my initial idea was to gather some wines that are in one way a little more ""on the far end"". Like one very sweet wine, one very sour wine, maybe one wine with less tannins and one with more... I hope you get the idea. So that in the end we might understand a little what the differences between wines are. Now to the obvious question, What wines would you recommend that are more on one end of a spectrum?
Thanks :)

tldr: 
I want to learn wine tasting by drinking wines that have strong characteristics."

It needs to be 

24 inch under counter built in fridge (front vent).

Preferably one zone (but two if it has to be)

Have a compressor

Be stainless steel

Hold about 44 or more bottles

Easy to move shelves

And most importantly - be quiet and also hassle free and reliable.

Cost $1600 or less (preferably lessâ€¦..)

  
I am not a wine connoisseur - I drink wine because I like a glass of wine each day.  I am not cellaring wine - I pick up a supply at Total etc and then like to stock the fridge so that it is there and chilled ready to drink.  

I have a Costco membership and some sort of Best Buy membership.

To be even more clear, Iâ€™m not asking about the approach to tasting, I use the WSET systematic approach to tasting, which is one way to taste and gather information, Iâ€™m more interested in how you take notes during the tasting.

Bucket list wine? - 05 d'Auvenay Macabrees,36,1gtg1cl,https://i.redd.it/kyo9kpoldh1e1.jpeg,8,2024-11-17 22:32:11,"2005 d'Auvenay Auxey-Duresses Macabree

Have always wanted to try Auvenay as some would say it's some of the best white wines in the world.

Caramel popcorn, struck matches, orange marmalade, white blossoms on the nose. The aromatics are insane.

On the palate, honey, a diffused citrus blend of lemons with oranges, some orange marmalade, a bit of cooked fruits, orange peel, crushed rocks, and a hint of baking spices. The honeyed mineral orange peel mix flows into the long finish, which glides down effortlessly. The finish balances out the honey caramel popcorn in the front of the palate so well that it keeps you reaching for the next sip. The wine feels decadent but light at the same time.

As it airs, more of that honeyed marmalade sensation comes out. 

One thing that I feel like it's missing is a bit of fruit and fruit intensity, but that might be because of the terroir. Nevertheless, amazing winemaking."

I didnâ€™t see a recent post about hills to die on so, why not start a new one. Hereâ€™s mine. Please let me know if you agree or not.

The wine hill I will die on is that blends are not more â€˜sophisticatedâ€™ or â€˜nuancedâ€™ or â€˜complexâ€™ than monocÃ©pages. I have heard this from both experienced and novice drinkers. My rationalization is that wines contain dozens of chemical compounds that determine taste and mouthfeel (can you taste colour?). (Chemically even hundreds, but most are trace amounts.) Does it really matter if you have 50 chemical compounds in a wine or 100? I would say no. Does â€˜valueâ€™ (I know, prices can be absurd, but letâ€™s assume wines can be valued more or less objectively) have anything to say here? And since many of the most valuable wines are monocÃ©pages (DRC to name just the most obvious), they are clearly not valued less than blends. Or is there another quality that determines prices for monocÃ©pages (besides obvious ones such as limited supply for top sellers such as DRC)?"

Splurge Review! 2006 Cheval Des Andes,23,1gt46gp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gt46gp,4,2024-11-17 10:03:44,"A few weeks back, I asked this sub which wine at my shop I should splurge on. The two wines that were most recommended were a 2018 Isole et Olena Ceparello and a 2016 Beaucastel CdP. While both of those wines look amazing and fall within my desired price range, I wanted a wine that would be a bit more approachable for the people I intended to share it with, meaning something with a little more age that required less decanting and didnâ€™t need to be paired with a meal to be truly appreciated. This 2006 Cheval Des Andes fit the bill perfectly, not to mention it was personally recommended by people whose opinions I trust.

""Cheval des Andes is the result of the union between ChÃ¢teau Cheval Blanc, Premier Grand Cru ClassÃ© â€œAâ€ of Saint Emilion, Bordeaux and Terrazas de los Andes, a pioneer of cool-climate, high-altitude winemaking in Argentina. Distinguished by its freshness, elegance and exceptional ageing potential, the wine of Cheval des Andes is the Grand Cru of the Andes.â€

Notes:

Such complexity right out of the bottle. Aromas of green peppercorn, dried leaves, tobacco, vanilla, roasted nuts, and dates. Itâ€™s all knit together around core of blackberry, but itâ€™s subtle, there in the background. 

With about an hour in the glass, the nose comes across warmer and and much more integrated. Iâ€™m getting tobacco, vanilla, hazelnuts, dates, cherry, and star anise. Really lovely. 

An hour and a half later, a lot of the same, but a thereâ€™s a distinct note of rich cocoa.

The palate is well-balanced, delicious, but a bit less expressive than the nose. As youâ€™d expect for a wine of this age, the acidity and tannins have mellowed, but for my taste, itâ€™s lacking structure. I was hoping for a little more power and a little more grip, just enough to give this wine a longer-lasting finish. That being said, itâ€™s still tasty and perfectly enjoyable, and at $70, I feel itâ€™s money well spent. Right out of the bottle, Iâ€™m getting notes of tobacco, blackberry, dried red fruit, licorice, and cloves. The fruit comes back to life the more this wine breathes. 

Verdict:

Loved it. Not perfect, but truly enjoyable, and so fun to share with good company. 93 points.

I travel to the US Frequently. All is different there. Contrary to popular notion, I think american wine tends to be extremely tastefull and creative. A flavourful Zinfandel is a great drink. However, it ruins my trips. After three glasses (or two bottles allike), it punishes me the next day. Relentlessly! Every single time.

I made a nice ribeye steak dinner last night and had a guest over and I thought to myself I wish I could have brought out a nice bottle of something to go with it.

The only wine I drink sometimes is when my wife gets Wolffer Estate Summer in a Bottle (a rosÃ©).

If you could recommend 1 bottle of each - red, white, rosÃ© - which would you recommend?

Preferably something not too hard to find and nothing too pricey (maybe $50 to $100 max).

I am not just asking for dinner wines so feel free to recommend anything!

"Old champagne, the only thing I want to drink anymore. ",57,1gsvw60,https://i.redd.it/uruhqbpvmb1e1.jpeg,10,2024-11-17 03:13:37,"Had the great pleasure of pouring these for some customers a few weeks back. This is my second bottle of 96â€™ VC LGD and I am a convert. This has aged so gracefully and really is strutting itâ€™s stuff, a kaleidoscope of flavors ranging from fresh fruit to sherry (in the best way possible) this is drinking at peak form and will continue to drink nicely for atleast a few more years. 

The biggest surprise was the 88â€™ Belle Ã‰poque rose, this was oxidative but the acidity maintained its freshness, wilted rose petal, autumn leaves, blood orange, burnt sugar. This to me showed more character and I found it to be more charming than the VC. While the VC was in peak form I just found the BE so interesting. 

I love mature bordeaux, burgundy in all forms, Old German riesling, etc. however vintage champagne has cemented a spot in my heart that my wallet is very upset about. "
"1973 Chateau Lascombes, Margaux ",45,1gstnxi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gstnxi,5,2024-11-17 01:32:21,"I have notes! First off, what a TREAT to open this 1973 vintage with my close friends! Chateau Lascombes is one of five 2nd growths in Margaux and is a mile west of Chateau Margaux. 1973 was a wet and hot season with a large, underripe crop. From what I understand, this is still a Cabernet weighted blend, bottled before Lascombes switched to Merlot based blends for their more modern vintages. 

On the nose sharp cherry jumps out at you with menthol and hint of olive. The palate starts with light, underripe tart cherry with some notes of pomegranate and dates. Quickly turns predominantly earthy though with heavy olive, tea leaves, tobacco, dried Italian herbs, bit of leather, and some mint on the finish. It is medium bodied at this point with medium plus acidity and low-medium tannins that are velvety at best. Such a smooth, earthy finish that lingers. It is past its peak for sureâ€¦but pleasantly surprised how it has held up. Would definitely drink now! 91 points. "

My question - I assume there are additives for both color and the back end sweetness? What are they, and why? And for California wines in general, is there any way to identify whether the wine has additives vs a true expression of the grape/terroir? 

If you donâ€™t know the producer, California wine is such a toss up. Wondering if there are any tricks to know whether they have these additives or not. "

Young wine, but even initial taste was actually pretty approachable.

With air, notes of dark plum and cherry pits came to the front, with slight yellow bellpepper notes. Fruit-forward without being jammy.

Slightly inky as well, I think that's the 15% Malbec showing.

Paired well with spicy Vijaywada Paneer Biryani (anyone who says Indian food can't go with red wines can leave now).

Solid Cabernet on a budget, would recommend to anyone wanting a fruity Napa Cab without breaking the bank.

75% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Malbec, 7% Cabernet Franc, 3% Petit Verdot.

My shop is considering bringing it in, so no price on it yet, but it will probably be somewhere in the $40-60 range. 

Notes:

Straight out of the bottle, the nose is pretty savory and rustic, showing off a bright core of raspberry, cherry and vanilla. Within 30 minutes, these aromas mellow out into a lovely bouquet of black currant, cherry, dark chocolate, chili pepper and peppercorn. Thereâ€™s a subtle floral element here too, but itâ€™s tough to identify. 

On the palate, notes of red cherry, strawberry, red bell pepper, and a touch of black pepper. Bright acidity is balanced against very fine tannins. This is a light and lively wine, but it still comes across as well-extracted, and the finish is long-lasting. Iâ€™m not experienced at scoring wines, but Iâ€™d give this lovely Austrian blend 92 points."

Owned by the Fayat family, La Dominique sits right next to Cheval Blanc, but the composition is different due to the soil being more clay based. 14 months in 60% new and 40% used oak. From 2017 onwards the estate has started using polymer and glass amphoras to age part of the wine to maintain freshness. I visited the estate this summer and its beautiful!

45min of air before assessing. 
Color: Deep dark red with garnet rim.
Nose: Very complex with dark fruits and spice. Lingonberry, ripe cassis, blackberry, blueberry , cedar. At this point in its development there is light cinnamon bread notes such as cinnamon, clove and nutmeg. Just a hint of funk / garrigue in the background.

Taste: Wine is open, medium+ / full bodied, polished and smooth. Tannins are still quite present, but showing first signs of being resolved. The dark fruited taste follows the nose. Very complex and long. Still developing as it gets air in the glass.

Long life ahead of this wine, but its showing beautifully open right now. 

Rest of the wine will tomorrow be paired with duck breast, carrot puree , roasted garlic chips and blackberry & raspberry reduction. "

**Project Topic**  
Our project explores the drinking habits of younger generations, focusing on alcoholic beverages and their alternatives. For some time we've seen a decline in wine consumption among people aged 20â€“30 compared to previous generations at the same age. To better understand why this shift is happening, weâ€™ve put together a quick 5-minute anonymous survey.

**Goal**  
Our goal is to uncover the reasons behind this trend and find ways to inspire younger generations to choose wine as their preferred drink once again. To achieve this, we would greatly appreciate it if you could take a few minutes to complete our survey.

Iâ€™m automatically thinking Riesling will be the star of the show, and I can do a comparison of dry to off-dry or sweet/late harvest. I also want to have at least one sparkling, because damn the finger lakes are popping off with sparklers the last decade or so. I know nothing about reds in the area (other than Dr. Frank seperavi) but people will expect at least one. Gewurztraminer also seems like it could be fun to include, as an iconic grape of the region that not as many people are familiar with.

I would love to showcase multiple wineries, and to feature wines that let me make easy 101 comparisons. Oaked/unoaked, low vs high acid or sugar, vintage v non, etc. 

I have a ton of ideas, but let me know if you have any thoughts! Iâ€™ll be traveling to the finger lakes in December, and the tasting event is in January. "

Buckfast Tonic Wine (No Vintage)

Screw cap, took it off about 30 minutes before to bring in some air. Apparently made by monks in England. Decided to try while cooking dinner. Poured into a glass, first glance has a very inky almost brownish color that you see in older wines. Very syrupy, liquid clings to the side of the glass when swirled. Almost 15% ABV.

Stuck my nose in and was hit with something I've never experienced before. Barnyardy funk (in a bad way) almost like a dead animal in a bird's nest. A mix of flat Coca Cola and caramel with a whiff of gun metal.

On the palate, overwhelming sweetness and sugar. Cherry Cola mixed with Benadryl. Unlike anything I've tasted. I'm not sure what this liquid is but it is not wine, I'm actually not sure what it is but it tastes like something a doctor would prescribe. A chemical concoction of the highest degree. Can only compare it to a Four Loko.

Managed to make it through a couple small glasses but not much more. Has absolutely ruined the evening drinking-wise for me as I tried to drink a nice Bordeaux after but the iron-like metallic sweet aftertaste I just couldn't get out of my mouth even after a few glasses of water. I don't drink a lot of coffee regularly so I also have mild heart palpitations from the caffeine after just drinking a bit of this and feel a slight migraine.

An ungodly concoction made by seemingly godly men. I believe the Vatican needs to send an exorcist over to Buckfast Abbey as the devil's works are cleary present there. After tasting this ""wine,"" the way I feel can only be described as akin to being under a bridge on one's knees orally pleasing a vagrant while simultaneously drinking liquified meth through a dirty rag.

I've drank a lot of wines in my life and will never forget this one."

I'm looking to buy a bottle of red wine as a gift for my friend who will be closing on a house soon as a celebratory gift/housewarming gift.

My friend enjoys red wine and from what I know, prefers:

* medium bodied wines (but doesn't mind full bodied wines over dinner)
* isn't overly sweet or dry (though I do suspect they like drier wines?) 
* has some complexity -- not sure what that means, does that mean some tannins? 

When we go out drinking and we have wine, my friend has mentioned enjoying really smooth red wines during their dinners? I'd ideally like to buy a red wine bottle that hopefully they would enjoy and priced around $75 to $150. I'm in NYC so if there's any shops you could recommend and what to look for or even ask the staffs/somms that would be amazing too! "

Tasted over the course of 3 days. 

Eye: radiant gold. 

Nose: intense burnt caramel, orange peel, marzipan. 

Mouth: opulent in the extreme. Vibrant acidity, highly complex and incredibly dense, initially follows the nose, soon accompanied by white peach, honeysuckle, scuppernong. I can still taste the sip I took 5 minutes ago. 

Continued to blossom over the three days, and if anything was clearer and more intense on day 3. 

Magical wine. Absolutely magical. It tasted like late childhood summers growing up in the United States Deep South. I canâ€™t wait until the other two I bought have a bit of age. "

* Color: Dark, reddish purple
* Nose: Red fruits, raspberries, blackberries, no perceptible alcohol
* Palate: Medium to low body, feels light on the palate, a little bit of pleasant acidity, mostly purple and red fruits, blackberries, round tannins, and dried herbs (maybe thyme)
* ABV: 14.5%
* Price: $18
* Food pairings: Fettuccine with ragÃ¹ Bolognese (really nice), Detroit-style pepperoni pizza, mild Italian sausage and tomato pasta, spiced kebabs and tehina on rice (best pairing)
* Overall rating: 6/10 (very good, a cut above)
* Notes: Purchased at Costco, so I figured a quick review might help others. It's not entirely clear who makes this wine. Bottle says *bottled* by ""Vignobles & Compagnie"" (Suckling also has them as the producer), but I can't find this expression on their site. They do make a CdP with Grenache and Syrah. Vivino has a CdP with a similar label and brand named ""Urbain V"" made by Gabriel Meffre, but this doesn't appear on their site either! Finally, the bottle says it's imported to the USA by MISA Imports, but it's not on their portfolio online. It's most likely a Grenache-Syrah blend."

Occasionally, it's fun to spend a bit more and try something of higher quality or more renowned. For these, I'm either doing some research ahead of time or talking to the somm in the store. 

As a new father, I thought it would be a fun treat to get a nice bottle when I finished my paternity leave from work. I'll also probably splurge each time my retirement account hits certain marks.

My question to those of you on a similar budget is, what are some other fun reasons to treat yourself to a nicer than average bottle?

   * 2020 Hermann J Wiemer HJW Bio Riesling (2 bottles) 
* Day 2: Make your own pizza 
   * 2013 Dom (2 bottles) 
   * I'm debating getting a red here, maybe a Rosso di Montalcino. I don't know how many people will just drink beer or cocktails with their pizza 
* Day 3: Grill night-This night will be a smaller group as some will leave. We'll probably have more steak than chicken but a selection of meats on the grill 
   * For red-I have a 2004 La Rioja Alta 890 that I wanted to open this weekend and I think this might be the night. I also have a 2009 Beaucastel cdp and a few youngish big cabs that I would be willing to take 
   * For white-2022 Suertes del Marques Vidonia V.P., likely just one bottle but I have more if needed

Saying all wine tastes the same is like going to an art museum with very blurry eyes and saying all the art looks the same (A thought exercise),0,1gqwa56,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gqwa56/saying_all_wine_tastes_the_same_is_like_going_to/,5,2024-11-14 11:00:05,"Edit: This is not at all a snobbery thing, as I'm a total beginner in wine.  I just think it's an actually true analogy.

Has anyone else ever used this analogy?  If you went into a museum with blurry eyes, you'd say everything is basically the same.  Only statues and crazy weird colors would stand out.  But most would look similar.

The same is true in wine.  Anyone will taste major differences between wines, but in the broad section of ""paintings"" aka ""reds"", folks often get confused.  But the more you learn, the clearer you see, and the more you notice there's a world of subtle difference between wines.  And yet it's not objective, it's to be interpreted.  It's not objectively better or worse in a measurable way.

Do people like this analogy?"

Beautifully balanced, its length in the mouth is notorious with impressive flavours of black fruits that persist on the palate.

\--

  
Very long overdue trip report. Thank you so much for all of the help from r/kelowna and r/wine! We stayed for a week, and targeted between 3-5 wineries per day. So many folks here helped us curate a list of places to visit, and we really appreciate you all.

Wineries we visited:

Cawston

* Crowsnest Vineyards
* Seven Stones Winery

Kelowna

* Priest Creek
* Quail's Gate
* Soma Craft Cidery
* Spearhead\*

Naramata

* Daydreamer\*
* Four Shadows
* Howling Bluff Estate Winery
* Kettle Valley
* Lang Vineyards
* Poplar Grove Winery

Okanagan Falls

* Meyer Family\*

Oliver & Osoyoos

* Bartier Brothers Vineyard & Winery
* Black Hills Estate Winery
* Culmina Family Estate Winery\*
* Fairview Cellars\*
* Phantom Creek

Summerland

* 8th Generation Vineyard
* Lightning Rock
* Solvero Wines\*

\*Highlights (very personal opinion though, we have something positive to say about all of them)

Overall, we had an amazing time. Summerland was the perfect spot for us to stay for the week, with easy access to wineries, trails, groceries, and the beach. I've marked our favourites above. Daydreamer, Fairview, and Meyer were particular highlights.

I feel that we got a good mix of different types of wineries, and have an extensive list of places we didn't get to go this time but would be very keen to visit.

Notable Wine and Tasting Notes

* There was no shortage of styles and varietals to try. We may have been biased in our winery selections. Typically it was cooler climate varietals, Burgundian, and it was rare to find blends.
* Lots of range in the varietals themselves. For example Syrah went from overwhelming black pepper, to barely any pepper if at all. The reluctant rose from Fairview stood out coming from a small planting of Syrah (which is sadly no longer there). The Syrah from Daydreamer, and bit less the Shiraz from the same location, was also great.
* After hearing about it, we asked for and we were allowed a free tasting of smoke tainted wine from Meyer which was quite the educational experience. Turns out you canâ€™t really taste or smell smoke from the juice. You can definitely taste and smell it after the wine has been made. Smelled like a newly painted room to me. Very obvious notes of some kind chemical on those nose but not at all pleasant in a way a Riesling would be. On the palette, the best way I could describe it would be if someone had infused the wine with tire smoke. To be clear, this was not representative of the wines from this winery in any way. They had some awesome chard and pinot.Â 
* Marechal Foch, a somewhat native hybrid grape, wasnâ€™t really our jam and tasted a bit like it too. It made for a surprisingly good port though at Lang Vineyards.
* Speaking of jam wines, there was also a fruit winery we literally stumbled into while looking for lunch at Sleeping Giant fruit winery. Tasted like what you would expect. Not a lot of nuance. All fruit forward, on the sweeter end but not too cloying. Apricot was probably our favourite. If Pie was a wine.
* Clos Du Soleil had some really nice Bordeaux blends. Very approachable, and easy to recommend to nearly anyone. Notably they also had their own take on a sauternes (called â€œSaturnâ€). No botrytis, but still a sweet wine with lots of complexity and a nice balance of acidity.
* For our palettes, we found the best QPR was from somewhat unsurprisingly, the smaller more quaint looking wineries. Not that we were shy from visiting the higher budget and bigger looking wineries.

Visiting Notes

* We had an â€œelevatedâ€ tour from Grape Escapes on the first day. It gave us a great initial impression of the range and variety. As we tasted it was also a great way to get suggestions to other wineries that might be more our style in both decor and palette.
* It cannot be stressed enough how many wineries there are. You could spend months trying wineries. If your visit is somewhat short you should try your best to choose carefully. The range in quality and styles can be quite large.
* The density of wineries in Naramata is certainly impressive, and we were very glad that we had a short list already ready. Suggestions from other wineries were always welcome.
* There is a wide range of wineries to choose from - some fancy, some down-to-earth, some in the middle. We were curious about the fancy ones like Quail's Gate and Phantom Creek, and were glad to visit. We enjoyed the more casual ones like Daydreamer and Fairview the most.
* Things were relatively quiet when we visited and it was likely due to a lack of harvest. Solvero Wines took us on an impromptu tour! Really lovely family-run place in a gorgeous setting.
* Fairview Cellars had a nice catalogue of back vintages and it was fun to try a bunch in succession, especially since the ownership has changed. Got to taste wines with 10 years apart between them.
* If we went back, we would want to visit Hidden Chapel. It is the new vineyard run by the previous winemaker from Fairview which was a big hit for us.
* Unfortunately the harsh conditions of the previous winter impacted the harvest, and it's been tough on many growers and workers. We saw many vineyards replanting, ripping out dead stock, etc. Weâ€™re curious how this will impact the region long term.
* We skipped Mirabel as they didn't have an appointment until relatively late in the day, and we were getting tired. But we ended up visiting a cidery (Soma Craft Cidery) which was much better than anticipated. And we got to feed alpacas, bonus!
* Everyone was absolutely lovely, and it felt very pleasant to be travelling to another part of Canada and still feel at home.
* Other than Quail's Gate, Blue Mountain, Mirabel, and Scout we had no trouble walking in for a tasting without calling ahead / scheduling. We aren't disappointed, as there were so many wonderful options but I think I'll coordinate the latter 3 on our next trip.
* The Spotted Lake down in Osoyoos was a very random stop. We turned the car around to go back and get a better look. If anyone goes to that area... I think it was worth a look."

Recent premox situation with Pierre Morey?,1,1gqej9p,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gqej9p/recent_premox_situation_with_pierre_morey/,11,2024-11-13 21:48:50,"Iâ€™ve had a few bottles of Pierre Morey (not PYCM) recently and all of them were equally, more advanced than expected. They were 2 bottles of Terre Blanches 2019 and a bottle of Les Tessons 2019, and they all come from a reputed importer in my country and two different retailers so itâ€™s unlikely this is a storage issue.

Is Pierre Morey known for premox issue in recent vintages? The bottles are sealed with natural cork so I guess thatâ€™s possible but I havenâ€™t heard too much premox complaints about the producer, and itâ€™s very odd to think 3 out of 3 bottles are premoxed. That said the wine was already getting gold and it has completely lost its flinty reductive characters and the wine felt kinda fat if not completely tired.

I had a bottle of Les Tessons 2019 just 2 years ago and the wine was pretty flinty and structured so itâ€™s hard for me to believe the wine changes this much just in 2 years. However Iâ€™m not experienced with white burgundy at this stage so maybe they were in their awkward phase. All the white burgundy I had before were either a little younger or much older. Someone with more experience with this producer or white burgundy in general, any thoughts?"

Iâ€™m 29 and recently got into collecting.
My local wine shop has a huge vintage section and itâ€™s in a low-income neighborhood so the deals are often ridiculous (for Canada/NA).

We are not looking for an expensive experience. Wines we sample generally run the $20-40 range give or take. Mostly wines that can be purchased and enjoyed through our local wine supplier or larger consumer grocery. 

Examples of recent meetings was one focused on Lujon winery. Another was focused on some Eastern European wines from Croatia, Romania and Hungary as a group was traveling there. This summer we did one called Chillâ€™in and Grilliâ€™in, about reasonably priced wine to drink while enjoying summer entertaining. 

We do talk about foods that go with the wines from cheeses to spicy to meats to seafoods, etc. 

Any help you can provide, or if you point me to any other source for information would be greatly appreciated.

â€˜Sommâ€™ = Certified Somm,0,1gq1yb7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gq1yb7/somm_certified_somm/,27,2024-11-13 08:59:26,"TLDR: to call yourself a Somm, do you have to be a certified Somm or does any advance wine cert count? 

Iâ€™m currently working towards WSET Level 3. I donâ€™t currently work in the industry but I could see myself doing it as a 2nd career or retirement job. I just love wine! 

My wife and I were discussing the semantics and connotation of â€˜sommelierâ€™ and whether one has to be a â€˜Certified Sommelierâ€™ in order to call themselves a Somm? Technically a Somm is just a wine steward. 

If/when I pass WSET level 3, Iâ€™d love to call myself a Somm, but I have some reservations: 1) I donâ€™t work in industry and 2) WSET doesnâ€™t focus on service. However, if I help others learn to love and appreciate wine, wouldnâ€™t that make me a steward?

I know I could always just pivot and take the CMS, but I honestly have no interest in the service aspect. I also recognize that at the end of the day itâ€™s a bit petty, but Iâ€™d still love your opinions. "

I guess you can say blends are an expression of the winemakers creativity and thats why youâ€™re still paying top dollar for the product?

I wonder what your opinions are on the quality of the wine if I am to bring them in their respective manner.

1. pour a bottle into a soft bottle, plastic pet or flask. do this the morning of travel and drink in evening.

2. use canned wine, never heard about it before actually. I live in the Netherlands.

3. strap the bladder of a boxed wine somewhere and bring this.(I feel like my options of choice of wine are limited by this when buying here in the Netherlands)

4.just strapping a bottle to the frame and opening when using it in the evening(less preferred due too chances of breaking, and added weight and inconvenience when packing)"

Iâ€™m a somm in Australia, usually if I have to make a selection for wines to consider and I havenâ€™t tried one Iâ€™ll default to Halliday to give me a rough idea of what to expect quality wise. Usually pretty reliable and really a great reference book as well.

When I look internationally, Iâ€™ve been using Suckling as my go to for looking at wines that I havenâ€™t had before and to be honest, I just donâ€™t agree with the ratings as much, lots of very average but highly rated wines, I feel like I just canâ€™t use it reliably as a resource for my job anymore. Also, not as comprehensive as Iâ€™d like as well.

The cooked wine experiment ,12,1goekwq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1goekwq,4,2024-11-11 06:48:59,"Ever wonder what would happen if you left wine in a 110 degree room for 11 days? Well, let me tell you because this is exactly what happened to our friendsâ€™ wine. 

Their house had to go through water remediation and part of the process was to blast their basement with hot air machines, which unfortunately cooked all their wine. While the wine wasnâ€™t anything high end or fancy, there were certainly a couple of bottles which I was familiar with that I was definitely sad to hear were ruined. 

Nothing turned into vinegar or tasted like stewed fruits surprisingly. The main theme was that pretty much all of them tasted flat and smelled like nothing. They werenâ€™t disgusting, just veryâ€¦blah. Meh. Pretty much flavorless. 

The only exception was the 19 Crimes. It was terrible, but that probably wasnâ€™t due to the heat. The heat did seem to kill the nose, but I picked up some weird root beer, sarsaparilla, cream soda, cola note, definitely like fake sugary kind of note. 

On the palate, it was some kind of caramel and Dr Pepper with a hint of cherry robitussin. I almost spit it out because it was so nasty. 

It was honestly kind of exciting how bad it was, considering everything else was so flat. If youâ€™ve heard of movies that are so bad theyâ€™re good, this was almost like that, but with wine, and it wasnâ€™t actually good. But it was fun making fun of the 19 Crimes wine and very educational to taste the other wines that had been damaged by heat.

Oh - the Prosecco honestly wasnâ€™t too bad either, but La Marca isnâ€™t great to begin with, so the bar was pretty low, but it still had good fizz and didnâ€™t taste all that noticeably worse than a normal bottle! "

The aroma from the glass is very strong, piercing, almost chemical at first. Very unusual but when tasting, itâ€™s opened up to a nice, beautifully layered little wine. Spiced cherry, crushed rose petals, a touch earthy. 

Paired well with dinner which was farmstand pork chops with crispy shallots and garlic butter served with roast acorn and delicata squash and Brussels sprouts with sage brown butter and crushed roasted hazelnuts. A little homemade cranberry sauce on the side, too. Probably a Chardonnay would have paired beautifully but I saw Collotte Marsannay in the shop and had to. "

You also suggested that a 50 year old cab would likely not be very good and to have a backup bottle, so I went to the store and without realizing it, bought another cab from the same vineyard.  So we had a bottle from 1974 and 2020.  Fortunately, the 74 was actually pretty good.  The color had faded a bit, and it had lost ""something"", but otherwise was enjoyable.

I'm a burgundy noob, so take my notes with a grain of salt.

Chateau De La Tour

Nose: Very balanced between red fruit, earth, tiny amount of spice, and a dusty note.

Palate: Very complex. Notes of spce, like black pepper, leather, tobacco, hints of red fruit. Very balanced. Also one unique note I can't describe, but it wasn't something I'm used to. Very high concentration of flavor, medium-high body

Finish: medium tannins, strong leather, dark chocolate, spice in the initial finish

Nicolas Rossignoe

Nose: More earthy on the nose, not much fruit, spice

Palate: Similar to the nose, earthy, leather, black pepper. Less concentration than the previous, slightly watery, but still very good.

Finish: Low tannins, but still present, slight amoumt of dark chocolate bitterness, good length

Two very good wines overall. I preferred the De La Tour, but these are basically my first two burgundies ever. Normally, we drink bordeaux, barolo, chianti, or Rioja and occasionally some new world wines, but not much Pinot in general. I did some research and found these wines over the past month and now I think I might have gotten some of my co-workers addicted to burgundy lol."

I've always felt Pichon Baron is capable of first growth tier wines and this vintage absolutely demonstrates that. 

Stood up 12 hours before drinking and opened two hours ahead of dinner. Decided to slow ox instead of decant, so the wine wouldn't fall apart.

Initially, needed time to open up, but after a couple hours, this was beautiful.

Notes of dark plum, dark cherry, arugula, allspice, and clove.

Long finish, mellow tannins and acidity.

This wine is at its peak, I think, but can also probably last for the new few decades.

94 points.

We did get to try some relatively expensive for us ($80-$120+ per bottle) wines, which is outside our typical $20-30 bottle table wine budget. However, the quality of these higher end wines was very apparent.  It got us thinking about increasing our budget to occasionally treat ourselves to one â€œexpensiveâ€ bottle every so often. But for that price, we want to be pretty confident weâ€™re going to enjoy it. Any advice on the best way to evaluate the value/quality of wine in this price range before making the purchase?

Objective criteria for wine quality,0,1gn59mk,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gn59mk/objective_criteria_for_wine_quality/,13,2024-11-09 15:00:14,"Hey r/wine! One thing that's been occupying my idle brain since ages is defining objective criteria for wine quality. Not a single score, definitely not a list of aromas and flavors, but relatively easily measurable characteristics that would correlate with the ""quality"", i.e, serve as a buying guideline for an intelligent but not-very-well-versed-in-wine-yet human.

Say, my wife sees Chateau TrouvÃ© for 20$, Chateau Perdu for 200$, and Chateau Ã‰garÃ© for 35$ in a shop. She checks the notes and they are like ""... minty-edge to the cedar, tobacco, cigar box..."", ""... dried roses, mint, tobacco, dried cherries..."", ""... mint, smoke, cherries and raspberries..."" â€” absolutely unhelpful for her to make a choice (she grabs the one with the nicest label or the one with more medals). What I think would help her, or some redditors here, to make an informed decision, is to mention that, say, the bottle of Ã‰garÃ© for 35 bucks is better balanced and is a bit more complex than TrouvÃ© for 20$.

Not sure asking AI helps (yet?). For example, Gemini seems to care more about classification, reputation, and critic reviews, not to mention it often gets basic facts wrong.

With that, here are a few of my criteria to seed the discussion:

* Balance, both in main compounds (acid, alcohol, sugar, polyphenols) and in taste perception

* Duration of the aftertaste

* Complexity of the story the wine tells, e.g., ""light and fruity nose but surprisingly deep note of cherry that evolves into whatnot and becomes thisthat...""

Petrus 1970.  Mid low shoulder fill.  Insanely depressed cork. I want so bad for this to be a miracleâ€¦

Haut Brion 1974 - Iâ€™d bet everything that this is toast. Never seen such low ullage. Iâ€™m still gonna open it up and smell it. Who knows? The bottle is a really interesting shape. 

Weingut Dr. Alex Senfter - nierfteiner Orbel Riesling Beerenauslese 1976 - this one has a nice looking level, but brown glass makes it hard to tell whatâ€™s inside.  Kinda have some hope for this one..

Beaulieu Vineyard private reserve 1971 - if only the petrus had the fill level of this one.  Decent cork and capsule position. Cellar tracker notes are not inspiring, but Iâ€™d be glad to open this up for science.

Porto Barros 1890 - I started shaking when I picked this one up haha. Not too familiar with ports this old.  The wax on the capsule is super crusty looking. The fill level is right to the top of the shoulder.  I have pretty high hopes for this one.

Offley Vintage Port 1963 - upper mid shoulder fill. Cork seems a little depressed.

Wasnt familiar with the producer, but plenty of available info!Grapes harvested on September 7, 2019 - then 15 months ageing on fine lees. Stored at 55, popped and poured - no decanting. Paired with a grilled salmon and some rice.

Visually, a strong ruby color, hints of purple at the edge. Beautiful color.

On the nose, I went in expecting the usual red fruits of a gamay - was incredibly surprised to pick up herbs and spices reminiscent of the Southern Rhone! Less flowers than I expected. Deeper into the glass, blueberries - with a hint of the usual strawberries and cherries I expected. Fantastic scents for a gamay, I'm sure partly thanks to the terroir of this Cru.

On the palate - medium bodied, yet still refreshing to drink. A pleasant tannin grip, perhaps I should've aired it out a little - yet balanced, with a good bit of acidity. No notable burn at all (label shows it as 11-14% ABV? Wild LOL. Never seen an abv >range< before.) Dry. Flavors of blackberry pie, blueberry jam - bit of pepper at the tail end. The herbs continue - a fantastic bit of complexity at the price point. Nice long finish. This was $25?

My first Cote-de-Brouilly, and I'm absolutely blown away here. The nose, the palate - fantastic value here. Delicious in every way, and I cant wait to track down other producers. Highly recommended!!"

(light, dry, fruity, chillable reds)",3,1gmuanw,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gmuanw/having_trouble_figuring_out_which_type_of_wine_i/,9,2024-11-09 04:58:22,"Full context, I'm kind of a noob so feel free to correct me if I'm saying something that contradicts itself lol

So far I've explored a bunch of red wines and figured out what I **don't like:**

1. Heavy, full, overly sweet reds (e.g. a lot of California reds like Zinfandel/Cabs)

2. Musty, chocolate, spicy, earthy tones

  
What I **do like:**

1. Lighter wines (leaning dry, but some amount of sweetness is nice)

2. Love love the chillable red wines

3. Floral/fruity scent/taste but not toooo sweet

4. Generally, I've found that the wines I like have a translucent/transparent reddish color? (like a french pinot/gamay?)

"2020 Domaine de Leyre-Loup Fleurie | Too much Cru Beaujolais, not enough time!",9,1gmqth4,https://i.redd.it/greitv5fbqzd1.jpeg,1,2024-11-09 02:27:42,"Purchased a bottle to go along with dinner at a local wine bar, No Reservations, in Miami - was in the mood for some Cru Beaujolais when I walked in, so happy to see it on the menu! Paired with grilled lamb chops. Served a little cold (felt like 35-40), but warmed up as the night went on - not decanted.

Visually, a strong purple color - once I put my flash to it!

On the nose, bountiful floral scents at the rim - a bouquet of lovely fresh flowers on a spring day. Deeper into the glass, strong notes of ripe strawberries and cherries. Took a bit to open up - but I pin that more on the serving temperature than anything.

On the palate, fantastically crisp and refreshing, especially chilled. Lightly bodied, pleasant acidity, barely any notable tannin grip - par for the course with the grape. Dry, with perceived sweetness due to the strong ripe red fruit flavor more so than any actual sugar. That same nose of cherries and strawberries resumed on the palate, bountiful red fruit. Delicious, albeit no real complexity of flavor to me. Decent finish, and a great pairing with the lightly seasoned lamb and vegetable salad.

The bottle went for $58, but the host reduced it to $29 for me, and for a restaurant bottle at that point, I was definitely very satisfied with the value (since $58 gets me some good Big 4 Morgon). Took half the bottle home where it promptly didn't survive the night. Will happily continue pursuing Fleurie and the other Crus (eyeing a particular Cote de Brouilly for tonight)! Looking up the producer online, I was happy to see them using very sustainable and organic farming methods, which will have me choose them again soon. Recommended! 

(Oh, and for any locals, the wine bar I mention above is fantastic)"

Great communication, and we ended up spending nearly three hours there. Seeing their horses, cellar, production facility, historic home, and vines was one of the highlights of our trip. The clarets and field blends were great and extremely interesting blends. The work theyâ€™ve done on their property and vines is evident in the product and the passion for what theyâ€™re doing. They were even kind enough to share what was left of a 92 vintage Niepoort (a birth year for several of us). 

We ended up buying several bottles and left with a few gifts from u/aligotegozaimasu as well! Their hospitality and kindness was above and beyond, and we couldnâ€™t have been more thankful for the time they spent to show us their work. If you make it to Portugal, I couldnâ€™t recommend them enough. 

Also, wanted to add that we booked a tour in the Douro with Miguel at https://ml-privatetours.com/ and had a great experience with them as well. "

Wine preservation in HDPE bottles ,1,1gmk3bx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gmk3bx/wine_preservation_in_hdpe_bottles/,0,2024-11-08 21:42:50,"We usually drink 100mg each so a bottle of wine is too much for one sitting, so I always pour the wine in a smaller glass bottle of about 500ml, then I might split it in 2x200ml and so on. 

Lately it became a burden as you always have to wash the bottle and to store them. Sometimes it's even pointless because you are not sure how much is going to be drunk. Sometimes my wife only wants 100ml and I don't, and I need even smaller bottles to preserve the rest. 

It's a mess and I want to throw all my empty bottles away.

I made some research into plastics, and as we all know the plastic is not really good for preserving stuff, but advancements in plastics have been made, specifically HDPE is a type of plastic that is highly inert and is also used in reusable water bottles. The main advantage here is that they are squishable so I never have to pour it in another bottle when I need just a little wine.

But most of the bottles that I find for sale don't look nice to keep wine inside. Maybe someone can suggest a specific brand. 

What are your thought on that?"

Out of curiosity, I researched online if there are any licenses involved. As you might expect, I got a lot of different answers, but no real final say.
I did find some sources claiming that wine is considered food and, therefore, you need full-on food licensing.

So at what point does a wine tasting room need a food license?  Does anyone with experience in tasting rooms have the answer?

"Mousiness in Wine - Would you send a bottle back? If so, when?",7,1glzze5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1glzze5/mousiness_in_wine_would_you_send_a_bottle_back_if/,29,2024-11-08 03:17:27,"Hello everybody,

just had a lovely meal in Paris with a bottle of wine that was pleasant to start, but unfortunately became noticeably mousey within 45 minutes. I'm more than open to natural wines, and have served and sold many, but typically I'm more used to wines that turn around the second day mark and was unpleasantly surprised that this was so noticeably faulty before the mains even hit the table.

This got me thinking about the changes in the dynamics of wine consumption and how the industry reacts to it. The whole process of tasting a wine prior to serving is focused on cork taint... So while working as a Somm, I would accept a return from a guest where the cork taint became prominent over time (ie not noticed immediately upon serving to the guest), I don't know how I would feel about a wine that became mousey over the course of a meal... Conversely, as a guest, I didn't feel comfortable returning a wine that had become mousey (even though it happened so fast).

I feel like I'm rambling a bit, but I'm curious - if you're eating in a restaurant, under what circumstances would you return a bottle of wine that had gone mousey? Do you think mousiness is given more of a ""free pass"" than other taints? And if so, do you think thats fair?

Hopefully I'm not opening a can of worms here but I'm interested. Both as someone who is neither staunchly pro or anti natural wine, but also as a consumer who is usually on the other side of the interaction.

Appreciate your insights. Cheers."

I think I picked it up for $80. Fill was high shoulder. Cork was fragile, but uncompromised. Had a couple of small glasses with some homemade lasagna. It was really solid. Color was a perfect red amber. Tobacco, black pepper, dark fruit, and tar on the palate. Well-balanced with a lengthy finish. Pleasant acidity. Pulled the original cork and re-corked with new, so I could use my Coravin. That's usually my move on these older bottles. Now I can finish the bottle over the next few weeks, with a small glass here and there. As an aside, I've noticed wines, while protected from ruin, do continue to evolve after tapping with the Coravin. So, I expect it will continue to improve over the coming days. "

 However when the temperature drops and it attempts to heat something is going wrong and the unit is tripping my mcbs on the electrical distribution board.

Does anyone have manuals or an understanding of how the unit provides heating before I empty it out and dismantle it to attempt a fix?

Quintessa: known for its long history of organic/biodynamic winemaking practices. 91% Cab Sauv and 60% new French oak. Dark berry fruit and granular, smooth tannins. Great acidity. 

Ornellaia: Bolgheri blend of 62% Cab Sauv, 31% Merlot, and a dappling of Petite Verdot and Cab Franc. Chalky tannins, earthy, tomato vine, and a jab of VA that improved with time in the glass. This one needs the most time to show itself out of all the wines tasted today.

2009 Drouhin Oregon Chardonnay REVIEW,40,1gkosej,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gkosej,4,2024-11-06 10:05:03,"Updating from an earlier post, with my first review here on r/wine! 

Iâ€™ve slowly gotten into the wine world over the last few years, and working in the fine dining industry, Iâ€™m lucky to be exposed to a lot of higher level bottles and people who are amazing and willing to share. My first epiphany moment with wine, the sip that turned on the light bulb, was a 2010 Roulot white burgundy. I was so intrigued and so thrown off by the amount of flavors and textures and feelings that the wine thrust upon me, I didnâ€™t know how to react. Following this experience, I was sent into a two year foray into white burgundy and have found myself with significantly lighter pockets since. As an avid drinker of Nebbiolo and lover of Italy, I had sworn France to be overrated and dull. Boy, did this day prove me wrong! 

Ive been chasing that dragon since, and landed on Meursault and Pouilly-Fuisse, or more southern burg whites as my palettes choice due to the richness, creaminess, and more oak, as opposed to higher acid and steely-clean, crisp Chablis counterparts. 

Today, we have a bottle that intrigued me when I saw it, excited me when I got home and did some research, and blew my mind when I opened it. 

2009 Drouhin â€œArthurâ€ Oregon Chardonnay, found this among 4-5 more, covered in dust in a south Florida liquor store. Hereâ€™s my novice review so we can all get this over withâ€¦

Med-deep gold color, almost amber, gold flake and perfectly hued. Intense nose, flooded with deep, rich, and creamy apple orchard notes, little bit of flint, lot of brown butter and seriously (SERIOUSLY) heavy popcorn, but it was so good, no chemical traces, just organic pure old butter. Insanity. Wine was dry, weighty, but so well integrated, little bit of tannin (from oak maybe?) but it was so dang smooth. Medium acid, high alcohol, full body, intense flavor, crazy long finish. This wine is outstanding and was preserved so well! 
Iâ€™m going to buy the rest tomorrow. Overall 9/10 and blew my expectations out of the water. So balanced, so tertiary. Rich and smooth oak, toasted sourdough, kombucha and apples, buuuttterr, brown butter, more butterâ€¦. Lots of vanilla and little nutmeg, soft cheeseâ€¦ marmaladeâ€¦ man it just keeps going. Thanks for reading and if you see one of these, I canâ€™t recommend it enough. The age has done this wine such a service and Iâ€™d say this is its prime. "

My HVAC let go in my cellar on Nov 1; coolant was leaking from my fan.

I was storing at 14C (57F) and it raised to 22C (72F) as of Monday (Nov 4).

HVAC company is coming by a week later (Nov 8).

Will my wine degrade at these temps if they were exposed for only a couple of days as well as the temperature increase was gradual and not thermal shock?

Disznoko 6 puttonyos 1993 from this weekend ,68,1gklu1v,https://i.redd.it/4wa1pyc4e6zd1.jpeg,4,2024-11-06 07:27:20,"I went to an event this weekend where I knew this bottle would be properly appreciated so decided now was as good a time as ever to open it. I've got one more stored away and I think I'll plan to keep it until about 2030 based off tasting this one. 

This like most post 1990 disznoko is a spectacular example of what tokaji can be. I opened this bottle for about 15min and then decided to decant and start to taste after another 15-20min in the decanter. We ended up drinking it over the next hour. 

Upon starting to drink this it was extremely bright, lemon curd, dried apricot, fresh ginger, white peaches, and the trademark botytris funk. Still quite fresh and lively. Weighty and sweet but had substantial acid to back it up. Over time it got a bit more subdued on acidity and came really into balance and opened up to where I feel it was ideal after around an hour or so open. Towards the end of the bottle it did begin to lean a little bitter and flabby as it had started falling off. Still plenty of life left but definitely thinking it will be in its prime with only a quick decant off sediment before drinking with good company in 5-6 years. "

It's been an overseas export from day #1 due to the fortification.   
All the terminology of styles is in English language rather then Portuguese (except for ""Colheita"").   
Its perceived as having a sort of an aristocratic personality.   
In reality none of those perceptions is wrong. But instead of attracting people, it scares them away.

I have the feeling that most people has not had a first good experience with Port. There's a lot of basic/cheap Port flooding the shelves and very little top tier cuveÃ©s or older blends...

  
I would love to know your opinion. How do you look at Port? Have you had a good/very good experience?

Black cherry and more earthly notes. Maybe even leather? Missing some nuance on the front end and really hitting heavily in the mid-mouth.

Decanted off the sediment and poured a taste right away. Holy shit if it wasnâ€™t still very much intact but downright ALIVE from the first sip. 38+ years later and this thing STILL had fruit. It was mostly tertiary, yes, but the fruit that was there was still identifiable. 

Currant, dried berries and touch of persimmon. Leather, tobacco and a toasty earthiness. The tannin had softened to the point of a fine grit sandpaper, but still added a noticeable mouthfeel and body. Med+ body and long finish. 

I canâ€™t even explain how much this thing changed over the evening. With every sip, every glass, it continued to evolve as if it were doing summersaults. Sometimes the tertiary dominated. Sometimes the fruit popped forward. It was crazy but always in balance.

Price:  $30 AUD (or about $20 USD) from IGA. I dunno about cellar door for this one, but it's usually $5-$10 more expensive

Help!!! Buying red wine as a special gift!,1,1gjqr34,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gjqr34/help_buying_red_wine_as_a_special_gift/,15,2024-11-05 05:07:28,"Hello all you wine enthusiasts! 

This post is coming from someone that knows extremely little about wine... like next to nothing.

A very special friend of mine is having a big birthday this year and I would like to get him a wonderful bottle of red wine given that he loves red wine.

Through the grapevine (pun intended), I have heard that he likes Cabernet Sauvignon.

I would love to spend under $120, but if there is something that's slightly more that's truly spectacular, I will do my best to still buy it depending on how much ""slightly more"" is.

Any suggestions would be IMMENSELY appreciated!

I'm not sure if I'm going to get that many responses, so thank you in advance to anyone that responds! ðŸ™"
"Have you ever advised, inserted yourself, or helped out an aging person with their wine collection?",5,1gjp4q4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gjp4q4/have_you_ever_advised_inserted_yourself_or_helped/,10,2024-11-05 04:00:37,"TL;DR - have you advised or helped out any aging wine collector population on the need to ""move"" wines, drink them, or get rid of stuff before it ages out? Even my healthy and hip Dad at 80 has a collection that isn't moving as fast, and I suspect we're seeing stuff die, and I feel like I should involve myself a bit.

\---------

I've worked my whole career in food and beverage in kitchens and front of house, then rooms ops and hospitality, eventually leading to design/build stuff, all since 1995. I've seen builds and helped with some wine rooms, in ideal and not so ideal situations. Then you move on... and old school inventory control still meant directors would ignore / miss some wine, or not sell it so it ages out and is no longer good. That's a bummer. It wasn't under my management, but I've seen some pretty stellar wine inventories get into disarray. It breaks your heart to see stuff turn or get ignored.

That being said, I notice baby boomers are both not traveling, nor eating or drinking, like they used to. Their cellars are full, and it's part of the ding the industry is having in re-inventing, modernizing, reaching new audiences, and competing with this temperance movement, weed, and interest in seltzers (the new Zima, Bartles and James, Smirnoff Ice, and this too shall pass). But they can't rely on boomers to buy, with as full as some of those cellars are!

But I do think there are a lot of personal collections that are turning. I mean, I'm 48 and I'm shocked what the pandemic did to my brain and time... I keep thinking a bunch of my collection is just 3 to 5 years old, and all of a sudden it's 15 years old, etc. So I realize there's a bunch of baby boomer collections that aren't being drunk as rapidly, and there are absolutely a bunch of cellars all over the world that just has turning or dead wines, and I want to know if any of you have done anything to prevent that?

I don't mean pilfering or self-interest, but have any of you helped a parent or friend by auditing a collection and sort of organizing what should be drunk or at least considered before it expires? How'd it go? 

I think this question might be extremely silly, so I might delete. Just curious if people have started seeing wine collections get ignored, sort of abandoned, and good stuff turning over time. Cheers all.

Visiting Jerez - Field Report & Recommendations,20,1gjonqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gjonqf/visiting_jerez_field_report_recommendations/,13,2024-11-05 03:41:28,"With Sherry Week kicking off today, I wanted to share my experience and recommendations from a trip to the incredible region of Jerez in early October.

**Background**: Iâ€™m based in Poland and got interested in Sherry two years ago through WSET 2. Earlier this year, I completed an intermediate course by Consejo Regulador Vinos de Jerez. I donâ€™t speak Spanish.

**Getting There**: Reaching Jerez is surprisingly easy. While thereâ€™s a small airport, taking the train is likely the simplest route, either from Madrid (\~4 hours) or Seville (\~1 hour).

**Getting Around**: The key bodegas (wineries) are in Jerez, SanlÃºcar de Barrameda, and El Puerto de Santa MarÃ­a. A convenient bus from Jerez (near the train station) goes to SanlÃºcar, and thereâ€™s a quick train to El Puerto. Iâ€™d advise against renting a carâ€”Sherry is fortified, and one tasting alone can be potent! Public transport is reliable, so thereâ€™s no need to drive.

**Arrival in Jerez**: We arrived in Jerez on a Sunday and stayed at a comfortable, reasonably priced accommodation booked through Booking. October wasnâ€™t crowded with tourists, and the weather was fantastic. The city is compact, very walkable, and filled with beautiful architecture. I wish I had more time to explore, but of course, the main goal was to drink Sherry!

The city is full of bars, particularly â€œtabancosâ€ (Sherry bars), where a glass ranges from 1â‚¬ to 5â‚¬. The quality is usually great, though there are occasional misses.

**Dining at La CarbonÃ¡**: On our first night, we had a reservation at La CarbonÃ¡ (https://maps.app.goo.gl/mJ411xqBpQS7KJ9X7), recommended by this subreddit. We chose the â€œLola CarbonÃ¡â€ tasting menu, which was 75â‚¬ per person and included 7 dishes paired with 7 different Sherries. Though there were some minor slip-ups (a shell in the seafood and limited English), the experience was a fantastic start to our trip.

**Exploring SanlÃºcar de Barrameda**: Early the next day, we took the bus to SanlÃºcar, a smaller seaside town with plenty of charm. Our first stop was Bodegas Hidalgo la Gitana (https://bodegashidalgolagitana.com/), which was incredible! The cathedral-like bodega building was awe-inspiring, and the tour was both informative and fun. For 19,50â‚¬, we tasted four Sherries, including two drawn directly from barrels with a traditional *venencia*. You even get to keep a branded glass as a memento. We left with a bottle of their Manzanilla Pastrana.

Afterward, we wandered to Bodegas ArgÃ¼eso (https://maps.app.goo.gl/YGtMGLEBheHYvbbP8) for a quick, free tasting in their shop. It was a good experience, though language was a bit of a barrier.

Our walk to Bodega Delgado Zuleta (https://maps.app.goo.gl/GXaJk9PvhGrDHRr29) led us to a pleasant surprise at Bodegas BarÃ³n (https://maps.app.goo.gl/zrCPuwmoGh5c84Vj9). Despite the language gap, the friendly staff gave us an impromptu tasting directly from the barrels. We ended up buying a bottle of their Manzanilla Pasada.

At Delgado Zuleta, we didnâ€™t have a reservation, but a kind staff member offered us a small free tasting. We sampled five or six different Sherries and bought a bottle of their Amontillado.

After a day full of tasting, we enjoyed a meal at Taberna der Guerrita (https://maps.app.goo.gl/qdwEh9vkcw4D6nuC6), another spot recommended here. The tapas were incredible, andâ€”perhaps inspired by all the Sherryâ€”we accidentally ordered bullâ€™s testicles! Also, be sure to check out their *trastienda*, a shop filled with Sherries.

**Sherry Museum at Bodegas Barbadillo**: We wrapped up SanlÃºcar with a stop at a small museum in Bodegas Barbadillo, which is worth a visit. Naturally, there was another tasting in the shop before we headed back to Jerez with five bottles in my backpack.

**Flamenco Night in Jerez**: That evening, we went to Tabanco El Pasaje (https://maps.app.goo.gl/WdU6Vhakca2TxiA4A) for a flamenco show. Although itâ€™s a popular tourist spot, the ambiance was great. We ordered a premium tapas set and enjoyed a house Amontillado that was so good we ordered another. The show itself was intense at first but very captivating.

**Touring the Iconic Bodegas**: The next morning, we visited Bodegas Lustau (https://lustau.es/en/) for a 30â‚¬ tour that included 7 Sherries (one VORS) and a vermouth. It was an amazing experience, and we bought a VORS bottle.

Later, we went to the renowned Bodega Tio Pepe (https://www.tiopepe.com/es-es/reserva). While the 24,90â‚¬ tour (4 Sherries included) was enjoyable, it felt a bit commercial with amusements like ""Sherry train ride.""

**Bodegas TradiciÃ³n**: Our final day began at Bodegas TradiciÃ³n (https://bodegastradicion.es/), which was absolutely outstanding. We received a private tour (as we were the only guests that day) with Ãgueda, who adapted her guidance to our deeper knowledge of Sherry. Afterward, we explored the ownerâ€™s private art collection, featuring Spanish masterpieces by artists like El Greco, VelÃ¡zquez or Goya. The tasting included two VOS, three VORS, and one Fino, all truly exceptional. This premium experience costs 55â‚¬ per person but is absolutely worth it.

**Final Stops**: Our last stop was Bodegas Fundador (https://brandyfundador.com/visita-bodega/), a large-scale bodega with a 30â‚¬ tour featuring three VORS. Afterward, we visited Vinos y Licores La Estrella (https://maps.app.goo.gl/aSXtcEMo37nSkkkr7) for a few final bottles before attempting a visit to the Consejo Regulador (https://maps.app.goo.gl/T7bcD9ZfdCJCZUh58), which, unfortunately, was closed during declared opening hours.

**Final Thoughts**: My trip to Jerez was unforgettable, and Iâ€™ll definitely be backâ€”maybe even next year. The region and its wines seem vastly underrated, which keeps prices affordable. And I still need to explore El Puerto!

**Bonus Tips**: If youâ€™re nearby, consider visiting Cadiz (a short train ride) and Seville. In Cadiz, GorriÃ³n (https://maps.app.goo.gl/NKt4MntEayq4EUfV7) is a great wine bar, while Baco Vinos (https://maps.app.goo.gl/mVEAHMfmXMtF8b3A8) is a well-stocked shop with English-speaking staff. Taberna La Manzanilla (https://maps.app.goo.gl/K9g5NUCgbu8VtzGj9) serves exclusively Sherries, many aged to VOS or VORS but declassified. In Seville, Vinoteca Lama La Uva (https://maps.app.goo.gl/55yxN3KHdSAu3o137) has an excellent selection and very kind, English-speaking owner, and Bar Casa Morales (https://maps.app.goo.gl/uxGHgZuVVxHSjUhQA) offers affordable, authentic, delicious experiences (the secret to get inside is to try all three different entrances).

Cheers, folks! Enjoy your Sherryâ€”not only this week!

Balade oenologique tasting package,12,1gjndkh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gjndkh,2,2024-11-05 02:49:17,"This is a tasting package of samples of BIO French wines. It's a blind tasting, you can read what you drank afterwards and they also provide tasting notes in French(see last images). I wrote my tasting notes before reading theirs, seems like for some of them we agreed for others not so much :) . First wine is no. 2, I forgot to take a picture of wine 1, it looked pretty similar to no 2 if a bit lighter maybe.

Wine 1
Sweet, apricot smell on the nose, as well as a bit of yeasty character and floral notes.
On the palate, quite acidic, and somewhat fruity, citrus with a bit of pear and apricot. Yeasty character persists on the palate.
Finish is more yeasty than anything else, lingering for a bit.

Wine 2
On the nose, pretty fruity, I think peach, yeasty notes here as well. The fruit persists on the palate, with a bit of a subtle thyme and oregano note going on as well, with the yeasty character here too. It also reminds me a bit of maybe a very fresh fruit tart? I don't know how to put it better. Quite savory, the finish is somewhat short. An interesting wine

Wine 3
A rose wine. On the nose, I'm honestly not getting much except for a slight floral note. On the palate, it's fruity, maybe some sort of red forest fruit, but again somewhat faint. The finish is surprisingly long and powerful, much more clear redcurrant than when you just taste it first. 

Wine 4
The first red wine. This is a light red wine, with musky and floral notes on the nose. Quite acidic, with light tannins. Body is thin. Definitely looks like Pinot Noir. I'm getting notes of cherry, plum and some almost tomato like savory note. In enjoyed this wine.

Wine 5

A much more corpolent red wine. On the nose, forest floor and redcurrant. Moderate acidity and tannins. Quite pleasant, easy-drinking but still somewhat powerful. I'm getting redcurrant and just berries in general. A bit of dried plum as well, especially on the finish. Finish is quite prolonged. 

Wine 6

A dark red wine. Pretty strong eucalyptus on the nose. Besides that, I'm also getting an almost cherry cola like note on the nose. Moderate acidity and somewhat strong tannins. The eucalyptus persists on the palate, being however complemented by cherry as well as dark fruit notes, such as blackcurrant and I think blackberry. Quite savory, long finish. Quite a complex wine, I really enjoyed this one.

My friends and acquaintances in the industry here in VA can recite lines from this film like Bible verses. So we popped a bottle of ABC Pinot and settled in....

And holy hell, what did I watch?!? This was peak 2000s douchebro stuff, and like most movies from this decade, to say it's not aging well would be an understatement. 

I also don't think I've ever watched a movie with two main characters who were so unlikeable with 2 hours of just lying to everyone about everything. Maybe because I didn't see it new, that I missed the cultural zeitgeist that this movie did to Pinot and SBC wine country? 

On the other hand, most of us know someone eerily similar to Miles. Complete with the over the top pontificating about tasting notes when they don't even know that Cheval Blanc is Cab Franc and Merlot. 

I also liked how they tied the 1961 CB to their own lives as 40 somethings who seemingly have already peaked, but the general feel of the movie is just too much 00s cringefest for me. "

I originally put the Krug upright in my normal fridge thinking Iâ€™d drink it in a few days so I didnâ€™t bother with immaculate storage precautions. Life got in the way and I donâ€™t want to drink it until the perfect moment (not rushing, etc). So itâ€™s been in the fridge upright for a month now. I donâ€™t have a wine fridge, so I put it back horizontally in the fancy box it came in which is some kind of cardboard with foam padding. Iâ€™m hoping this will provide a layer of insulation against temperature fluctuations of opening and closing the fridge door.

Kirkland 2023 Russian River Valley Pinot Noir,3,1gj5mdu,https://i.redd.it/6wney2a95tyd1.jpeg,6,2024-11-04 10:54:25,"Being relatively new to Costco, the idea of a serviceable weekday pinot noir (from the RRV AVA no less) for only $12 seemed intriguing.

Itâ€™s not as good as I hoped it would be, however, it managed to beat out the Belle Glos I reviewed a few days ago. Anywayâ€¦.

A little sweet for a pinot, and slightly heavier in mouthfeel than average, but for $12 itâ€™s not unbearably so. Itâ€™s just enough to remind you that youâ€™re drinking a mass produced pinot where some corners have been cut, and some liberties taken.

This is all red fruit, with cherry, raspberry, and strawberry. No dark fruit here to really speak of. Immediately following is the earthy notes of oak, smoke, and leather. Normally tasting notes of smoke and leather in wine is something that I absolutely love, but the residual sugar, vanilla, and heavier mouthfeel cloud over it all. Medium to medium-high acidity, although the slightly heavier mouthfeel impacts the versatility. 

Not bad, but also not something Iâ€™d buy as a weekday staple. This is a wine you bring to a party as an afterthought. I would drink this if served it, but this will remain a house party ice bucket bottle. 

My current weekday pinot staple remains Pacific Redwoodâ€™s Organic Pinot. At only $17 per bottle, Iâ€™ll gladly pay that small premium to get a much better product, even if it is usually a bitch to find.

This wine had a garnet color with a vivid ruby rim. I picked up notes of black cherries, peppercorn, and cedar with a hint of flint. With a medium body and a delightfully long finish, I found this wine to be thoroughly enjoyable.

Advice: M. Chapoutier Condrieu Schistes d'Agrumes,2,1gj1m83,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gj1m83/advice_m_chapoutier_condrieu_schistes_dagrumes/,7,2024-11-04 07:23:30,"Just wanted to ask for a bit of advice. A liquor store has the wine in the title (2021), which is normally â‚¬42, but is now on discount to â‚¬31.50. It's still a bit of a high price for what I usually want to spend, but I'm willing to spend it on something I think I'll enjoy (e.g. last week I picked up a 2007 Colheita port from Dow's for a similar price that I'm thoroughly enjoying).

I'll explain my tastes so that you have more information to recommend buying/not buying a bottle. I tend to far prefer fortified wine, port especially, but I'm currently in the process of learning more about wine since I want to explore the wine world. I tend to prefer white wine over red. I (somewhat) like chardonnay, but am not a big fan of sauvignon blanc. In terms of red, the ones I like the most are pinotage and shiraz, but don't really like cabernet sauvignon. I also like procescco.

I received a hearty recommendation for Chapoutier from someone I know that very much enjoys wine, and tried a bit of pinot noir from Chapoutier, which was pretty good. That's why I'm considering this bottle. I also bought a bottle of CÃ´tes du Rhone and CÃ´tes du Rhone Blanc from Chapoutier, but those two won't be opened for now (since there are several open bottles that need to be finished first), meaning I don't have a base point of comparison.

Would you guys recommend buying the bottle? Sorry if it's quite a lot of text for what might be an easy yes or no for you, but I'm curious about the wine and don't want to potentially waste my money."

This is an inexpensive bottle so not expecting anything on the palate.  On the label, it says they ""made using only the highest quality Pinot Noir grapes"", ""delicate salmon colour"" from maceration, ""intense peach watermelon and candyfloss flavours"".

Oxidation, med amber. I see some viscosity as well.
I pick up dried orange slices, dried dates, mushrooms and cedar.
On palate, I want to say old strawberry jam, ginseng, and cinnamon.
Intensity I would have to say low+, low acidity, offdry, short.

I kept it in a small decanter to see if it developed any further, but nothing other than increase in acidity.  Before turning into vinegar, I made into a reduction to top on vanilla ice cream.

Light straw in color with very fine and light bubbles. 

A bit closed on the nose but gentle aroma of brioche, lime skin, candied lemon, grape soda.

On the palate, brioche, green apple, mandarin, lemon peel, lime cordial, with a bit of flinty minerals on the finish which is very long. 

Overall wanting a bit more on the nose but a very luscious and easy drinking champagne with a beautiful lingering finish.

92+ points.

1972 Taylor Fladgate Late-Bottled Vintage Port:

Deep copper in color, slight cloudiness and small amount of sediment.

On the nose, golden raisin, milk chocolate, caramel, cinnamon, dates.

On the palate, confirming the nose with hints of dried candied orange peel and baking spices.

A bit more diluted, and reflective of a somewhat weaker vintage but enjoyable nonetheless.

My go-to reliable whites for casual drinking. I can never say no to a bottle when I'm out searching for more bottles, and at a comfortably priced $15 at my local wine shop, an easy purchase to try out a new producer. Stored at 45, popped and poured - to note, it's a screwcap! Sipped sans pairing on the first night, paired with grilled chicken and potatoes on day two.

On the nose, faint floral scents at the rim - honeysuckle and citrus blossom. Further in, familiar notes of grapefruit, lemon - surprisingly no stone fruit, as I would've expected - faint apple. The first night it smelled like an entry level Bordeaux Sauv Blanc (some melon waved hello) - but on day two, the scent was much more what I'm used to from the region. Strong citrus. 

On the palate, quite light - medium dry, so there is a tasty bit of sweetness. Not as much acidity as I would've hoped, a little restrained in that regard for my tastes. Also, at 12.5%, zero noticeable burn to speak of. In composition, a super easy drinker! Flavors of apples, lemon, lime - none of the nutty flavors I've grown to love in higher end examples of the appellation - very citrus dominant, like the nose. It's still in the mid 80s here in Florida, so a great white wine to enjoy chilled outside.

At the price point, I still favor Maison Darragon or Famille Bougrier, but it's still a good example of entry level Vouvray - refreshing and tasty. Recommended! "

Honestly very happy w this since Iâ€™ve had much worse canned wines 

Iâ€™d say it was good because it was well balanced and lingered nicely. Maybe it had enough notes to have depth but not enough for me to be confidant saying so and not intense enough to tick that box.

So clean yet full of flavour, current vintage sold out on the first batch they made (i tried to get a few more bottles but no luck), portugal is back on track (the cheap bulk wines in europe moved from the south to the east of europe so they have to move as well and they did).

Another producer from that region Filipa Pato, also recommanded.

Proud of their region, local grapes. 10 euro a glass at the bar, i guess 20-25 euro a bottle local price. 

So much flavour and freshness at the same time, low alcohol due to the atlantic ocean. 

WOW, also the same in Germany, France and Italy. Be authentic and dont mess around too much, wine without makeup is the slogan from Filipa Pato.

I was only in Portugal for 4 days, but it will get a more prominent place in my wine cellar."

I know its seasonal and the good and bad years effect the tastes over the years. But to be sold out completely? I recently read some wine article mentioning people are buying less mass market wines and this has effected its sales along with the growers in California.

I can only assume that this is a cut cost solution by reducing its products and probably phasing out certain brand styles.

These are becoming my two go-to Barolos for highest QPR. The Vajra I feel is pretty commonly suggested to punch higher than the price. The Vietti is a staple producer and is hard to go wrong. For between $35-$45 itâ€™s hard to beat this. 

Do you have any suggestions that you feel are better for high QPR in this region?

Notes: I had these both earlier today so I have to  off memory so my post doesnâ€™t get removed. 

Vajra: classic brick Barolo color, bright red cherry, rose, tar, slight licorice. Medium high tannin, medium high acidity. Lots of fresh red fruit, well balanced. 92.

Vietti: Slightly more ruby than brick. Also lots of bright red fruit, tar, almost a meaty scent as well to it. Extremely smooth tannins balanced with a bright acidity. Well balanced and potential to cellar. 93. 

The 2020 year so far is close to 2019. Seriously a great vintage so far, lots of depth and potential to cellar. Still very young but the Barbarescoâ€™s and Langhe Neb are drinking beautifully now.  "

Recommendations for a town as home base to explore wineries in Tuscany?,2,1gi6554,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gi6554/recommendations_for_a_town_as_home_base_to/,9,2024-11-03 03:52:48,"I'm going to be in Tuscany for a week next July with my wife and our toddler.

Opened 1 Sizies and it was was corked but luckily this second one was singing. 21 years old and plenty of vibrant fruit. Firm texture I expect of Beaune with forest floor, dried flowers and a hint of barnyard all playing second fiddle to black cherries, macerated strawberries and raspberry notes. All bursting from the glass. Palate is also a mouthful of ripe red fruits with whispers of earth, flowers and spice. Finish is not incredibly long but sufficient to warrant this 1er cru's reputation. After about an hour in the glass, tertiary notes begin to take over and the age shows. The fruit doesn't disappear but it steps into the background for all the earthy funky floral notes to pop out. Onto the Sancerre Rouge. Obviously more a contrast than comparison but wow what a difference! Smoky, dark and brooding. My fiancÃ©, who's notes I love, said it smells like a pirate. Big, big nose wafting out of the glass. Blackberries and cassis, aforementioned smoke, baking spices. Almost smells more Rhone than Loire. Same on the palate. Full bodied, silky tannins, well balanced overall. Ripe fruit, complex secondary notes, long finish. Cheaper than the Burgundy, too. (I suppose that's a given these days.) Both paired quite nicely with Chinese food. (Pinot and Chinese is one of my go-to's.) Cheers!"

Napa Sauv. blanc - help me understand (and possibly help my marriage),13,1ghvs5y,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1ghvs5y/napa_sauv_blanc_help_me_understand_and_possibly/,41,2024-11-02 19:54:58,"Hello!

My wife and I made a trip through Napa valley this summer (first time!) and went to St. Supery based on a recommendation from a friend.  They are well known for their sauvignon blancs, which are spectacular.  We liked their wines so much we joined their club even though we're on the east coast.  We have not EVER joined a club before, so that's how much we liked their stuff.

Fast forward a bit, and we have received a few shipments.  One of these wines - specifically [this one](https://www.stsupery.com/product/2023-rutherford-estate-vineyard-sauvignon-blanc/) \- is causing a disagreement between us.  While the taste is still wonderful, the wine has a strong, pungent, wet wool, dirty sock smell.  It his me in the face...this is not a subtle note.  But, my wife doesn't smell it at all, and thinks I'm nuts.  Usually she's the one that's able to identify flavors and notes more than me, so this is surprising.  This has happened with two different bottles form two different shipments, so I don't think it's related to an anomaly in storage, cork, etc.

I have a few questions for the experts here:

1 - Is this smell unique to the one drinking?  Is this sort of a cilantro/soap situation where I can smell the odor, but my wife is unable?

2 - what can cause this odor?  I've read a few articles that cite the reason as either lightstrike due to improper storage, chemical contamination, or bad yeast.  But, this is above my paygrade to answer.  I can say that we store all the bottles in a medium size, temp controlled wine fridge in our basement.

3 - is this an intended characteristic of the wine?  We've tried a few of the St. Supery Sauvignon Blancs and the Rutherford Estate is the only one that seems to carry this particular nose.

Would love to hear thoughts from you all!

Initially muted on the nose but eventually showed sweet oak, caramel and soy sauce/hoisin. Some sweetness on the attack. Dried figs, dark cherries and blackberries, with pleasant notes of undergrowth and mushroom. Quite advanced for 2018 and reflected the warm vintage. This took about 1.5 hours to come together but when it did, it sang. 94 points

Morey-Saint-Denis 2019

Sweet oak, violets, brambly fruit on the nose. On the palate sour cherries, strawberries, cranberries. Vibrant, zippy acidity with a spicy finish. Exuberant, youthful and beautifully balanced. Oak seamlessly integrated with fruit. Faded a little as the night went on, but so delightful while it lasted. 94 points

Open Your Wine Autumn - September and October roundup,16,1ghf6wl,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1ghf6wl/open_your_wine_autumn_september_and_october/,1,2024-11-02 03:33:43,"Some of you may have read my previous post on this topic, but for those of you just tuning in, Open Your Wine Autumn is a new tradition I have inaugurated which is exactly what it sounds like: A season-long excuse to open any wine that needs an excuse for opening, a yearly cure to the plague of ""waiting for a special occasion"" to crack that nice bottle you're sitting on for no compelling reason. As autumn calls to mind the natural cycles of aging and death, the wise wino, never taking life, health, or time for granted, knows to drink up while they still have the chance. Or, to put things in a slightly more grounded way: I get really bored of only ever opening 'responsible' weeknight bottles ad infinitum when I know I've got more exciting stuff sitting in my fridge, and I want to go a little apeshit for going apeshit's sake from time to time.

To that end I have put my modest amount of money where my mouth is and opened a few of the nicer bottles in my collection since September. I've done this on random weeknights, I've had them with burgers and shawarma and Popeye's and Chinese take-out, and I've consumed every one of them on my living room couch, mostly in pajamas. Since I've got until December 21st to keep #OYWA up I've not yet escalated to the bottles I've been most precious about (stay tuned for the December roundup for those), but I have dusted off the far reaches of my wine fridge and cleared out a good number of lovely bottles which had been waiting patiently for anywhere from 1-3 years for me to get around to drinking them.

In no particular order, here is the most recent batch of the wines I have opened so far this autumn in the spirit of OYWA:

\---

Alessandra Divella Dosaggio Zero Rose de Saignee NV - This stuff was incredible, I love good Franciacorta and having really enjoyed Divella's 'NiNi' at the Four Horsemen a year or two ago I was very excited to find another of her zero-dosage wines at a local shop. I didn't take very detailed notes on this ('strawberry' and 'yeast', ok, very helpful, past me) but with a bit of air on it it went from deceptively simple to absolutely screaming with flavor and aroma that'd make any grand cru grower champagne jealous. Not sure what the hell I meant by ""almost carnal"" but that's in my notes too? Fascinating color, a kind of rusty pinkish sultana raisin hue. World class Franciacorta, will be an insta-buy if I ever come across it again. This stuff begs to be paired with a meal; I think I had mine with fried chicken?

Catherine & Pierre Breton 'Les Perrieres' Bourguiel 2015 - This was a slightly shy Cab Franc that really wanted some time in a decanter to start expressing itself, but an absolute pleasure to drink once it did. Serious depth of flavor with your typical herby-peppery raspberry and earth accord, structured but easy drinking (""digestible"" if you like) at the same time. Had it with a burger and mac salad and could not have asked for a better pairing.

Chateau Simone Palette Rouge 2009 - Had been seeing this gathering dust for ages at a local shop and I'm glad I rescued it. One of those interesting southern French blends, mostly Grenache and Mourvedre with a whole hodgepodge of supporting grapes. Reminded me a bit of a Bordeaux at first with its strong red fruit-mineral-leather thing it had going on, but with sufficient air and warmth it started showing really interesting eucalyptus and licorice and garrigue notes. Really beautiful at 15 years and seemed like it would only get better with more age.

Olivier Horiot ""En Valingrain"" Rose des Riceys 2018 - I had the En Barmont a little earlier this year and loved it, and I liked this one even better. Fascinatingly 'textural' Pinot Noir, it has this kind of mercurial combination of density and lightness I find very hard to put into words; at the risk of getting too silly here it has a certain mysterious, magical energy and otherworldly tension to it. In any case I could drink a pail of the stuff; very tasty strawberry and sour cherry notes, herbaceous, a touch of cedar or pencil shavings. Really cool dark ruby color too, the kind of wine you want to look at with a flashlight. If those red health potions you drink in video games were real, this is what drinking one would feel like.

Domaine de l'Enclos Chablis GC 'Vaudesir' 2020 - One of my favorite white wines I've had all year, the kind of Chardonnay that just puts a smile on my face. I was enjoying myself too much to take detailed notes (I recall lemon, mineral, and smoke) but I did note that it was both serious and deep enough I wanted to take my time with it and also delicious and refreshing enough I wanted to neck a liter of it and ask for seconds.

Domaine de la Chevalerie Grand-Mont Bourguiel 2015 - I enjoyed this, although after having sat on it for nearly 3 years I was left wondering why I waited so long as it didn't really feel all that momentous. (That's the benefit of OYWA, I guess.) Interesting lychee black tea and barnyard notes which I find typical of this kind of low-intervention Loire Cab Franc, a bit of spice, raspberry, leather, plum, a bit of earth. Deep purplish-garnet color. If you've had Chevalerie's other offerings you can imagine a somewhat more structured, ageworthy version of those and you'll know exactly what you're in for with this."

Your favorite Aglianicos,5,1gh7yi1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gh7yi1/your_favorite_aglianicos/,7,2024-11-01 22:23:31,"So I recently got back from a trip to Italy, we were lucky enough to visit Rome and Naples and I made it a point to try some local wines. In my first couple days in Campania I had tried a Taurasi Reserva and another Aglianico and noticed both had a sort of bitter taste or bitter finish that I wasn't enjoying. On a trip out to Amalfi Coast we stopped at Ettori Sammarco, a small winery right on the coast in Ravello. Which I highly recommend stopping in if you're in the area. Very family feel, they have a little tasting counter in the winery and the founder/owner was right there overseeing the work and chatting with us. I believe he is 92 and still involved!I tried some delicious whites and some of their reds and fell in love with their reserve that is 70% Aglianico, 30% Pie de Rosso. It had none of the bitterness and everything I loved about the other wines I had tried. Talking with the host and the owner they mentioned there are multiple types of Aglianicos and the terroir of Ravello is part of why their wines don't have the same bitterness as others. 


I brought some bottles back that I'll sit on for a bit but I'm looking for other recommendations of Aglianicos that don't have that bitter note. As much as I'd love to order direct from Sammarco, ordering by the case with international shipping isn't in my budget at the moment (maybe as a treat down the road). I also get the feeling the other Aglianicos I tried may have been too young and those bitter notes may mellow out of the years. So I'm not opposed to grabbing some bottles to set aside. "

Biggest flavors were leather, tobacco, dry leaves (maybe the Pennsylvania fall affected my taste buds). Each pour I enjoyed more than the previous.

I'm hosting a Burgundy-themed wine evening tomorrow, and I'm curious as to people's thoughts on whether I should decant the reds.

When I've previously hosted wine evenings, I tend to double-decant the reds a couple of hours beforehand, especially younger reds, to allow them to open up a bit. However, I've got a couple of older wines this time and I'm not certain if I should double decant them. 

Below is my selection of reds from across the CÃ´te de Beaune, CÃ´te Chalonnaise, and CÃ´te de Nuits (in serving order):

* Domaine Denis Carre Bourgogne Hautes CÃ´te de Beaune 2019,
* Moillard Volnay 1er Cru â€˜Les Santenotsâ€™ 2011,
* ChÃ¢teau De Pommard Clos Marey-Monge Monopole 2014,Â 
* Joseph Drouhin Rully 2021,Â 
* Domaine Desvignes Givry 2020,Â 
* Domaine Jafflin Nuits-St-Georges 2020,Â 
* Domaine Marey Gevrey-Chambertin â€˜La Justiceâ€™ 2022,
* Domaine Drouhin-Laroze Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru 2013

Any thoughts greatly appreciated. Thank you.

Decanted and aired / consumed throughout evening.
Initially paired with steak, mushroom cream sauce, in duck fat baked small potatoes and a simple salad.

This 08 felt quite light and delicate on the palate.
However, balanced and refined â€¦ not as harsh as some 08 can be.
It has your typical Bordeaux feel and taste.
Can I say that it had more feminine treats than initially anticipated ?

Great wine â€¦ never got boring â€¦ loved it !

Palate: very concentrated, expressive citrus notes (orange peel, lemon), well integrated oak (vanilla, lees characteristics), minerals, very long finish

Beautiful freshness really helps balance out the high alcohol (15%) and oak notes, gives it energy and acidic grip that melts into a long, waxy finish. Not usually a fan of big oaky whites, but that was very moreish.

Guigal ChÃ¢teau d'Ampuis & Bellefont-Belcier Saint-Ã‰milion Grand Cru or a single bottle of  Guigal Ex Voto Ermitage Blanc?

I've been thinking about what to go with (I havenâ€™t had any of them before). Iâ€™m fairly confident about enjoying the reds; Iâ€™ve had Saint-Ã‰milion in a similar price range in the past, and while I liked it, it didnâ€™t leave a lasting impression (so maybe skip? save some money). Iâ€™ve never had a CÃ´te-RÃ´tie, though Iâ€™ve heard excellent things, and I know ChÃ¢teau d'Ampuis has a solid reputation. Iâ€™ve enjoyed Syrah based wines before, so I feel like it could be a good fit.

As for the white, Iâ€™m less familiar with white wines in general but have been intrigued ever since Konstantin Baum introduced the 2012 Ex Voto in one of his videos. The bottle available isnâ€™t a 2012, but Iâ€™m still curious to try it and have high expectations.

Sadly at the moment I don't have any information about vintages, but I expect them to be fairly young ones (towards latest releases if not the latests). It might also be important to mention I don't really plan on aging any of them, might not drink them when they come but soon enough.

So... what do you guys think? What would you go with?"

Review: Belle Glos Clark & Telephone Pinot Noir,95,1ggsgoa,https://i.redd.it/q7t2w7efi6yd1.jpeg,56,2024-11-01 06:47:15,"Soâ€¦this says pinot noir on the bottle, but this does *not* taste like pinot noir. This tastes over-extracted and is syrupy in body/mouthfeel. Dark purple in color, much darker than a pinot noir should be. Needless to say, I can immediately tell this is heavily manipulated like Prisoner and Caymus.

Heavy notes of sweet vanilla, and oak thatâ€™s of an unnatural character. The fruit is a non-distinct mix of mostly dark and some red. I can make out lots of blackberry,  and some cherry and smoke.

This is neither elegant or structured. I would honestly look elsewhere for a quality pinot. It doesnâ€™t even taste that good generally. 

This ainâ€™t it. "

There is currently allot of websites quoting this one guy who did a research project that says wine does not need to be stored horizontally.

The problem is his study only lasted 5 years and in many of the articles he references the AWRI (but the AWRI says wine should be stored horizontally)

  
[https://www.awri.com.au/industry\_support/winemaking\_resources/storage-and-packaging/post-packaging/transport-and-storage/](https://www.awri.com.au/industry_support/winemaking_resources/storage-and-packaging/post-packaging/transport-and-storage/)

He claims that after a 5 year research project that corks will last almost indefinitely in the upright position.

Obviously that does not make sense as real life wine collectors know all to well the issues with dried up corks.

Does anybody know of any other research proving him right or wrong?

Help choosing a bottle for my 21st bday,0,1gfoac7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gfoac7/help_choosing_a_bottle_for_my_21st_bday/,1,2024-10-30 21:47:34,"Hello,

I just turned 21 the other day and to mark my ability to legally purchase a bottle of wine I plan on buying a nice bottle of Bordeaux. I have done a ton of research over the past few months about wine, especially Bordeaux. I'm also pretty familiar with wine because my dad is in the wine business. If I'm being honest though, I'm just starting to appreciate wine, and I don't quite know yet what my personal preferences are. With that being said I want to buy a bottle of Bordeaux to start my cellar with. I narrowed my search down to 2 wines 2020 Figeac or 2020 Chateau Ducru-Beaucaillou. If I am going with rankings, WA gave the Figeac 100 points (My dad says WA is the best ranking followed by WS). On the other hand, I think the Ducru Beaucaillou is a little more elegant which I think is more my style(I just don't know yet for sure though). Another major criteria I have is which wine will be ready first. I would like to drink these wines within the decade. Does anyone have any thoughts? I do plan on buying a few other cheaper wines to get started but I wanted a nice bottle to store. Sorry for the long post I just don't know what direction I should go.

I donâ€™t think traditional tasting notes work for these wines, Iâ€™d have to tell you about the wildly high volatile acidity on the red and the almost too much texture on the white and we would fixate on that and never get to the important part. 

These are emotional wines, thereâ€™s not many producers that can make you feel as much in a wine as Kenjiro does, that doesnâ€™t mean the wines are easy by any means, I think most people would be surprised and probably not understand if they saw just how much VA is in the wines but then you taste them and the only reaction is to smile.

Wine regions that have been generally losing quality recently?,27,1geyjfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1geyjfe/wine_regions_that_have_been_generally_losing/,61,2024-10-29 23:17:28,"Hello! It seems like, recently, most wine regions have been improving in quality, with better modern winemaking and viticulture techniques (not to mention climate change improving growing conditions in some places). As itâ€™s often said, this could be considered the â€œgolden ageâ€ of wine quality. However, thereâ€™s almost always exceptions to the rule. Are there any wine regions that used to be highly regarded, but are now looked down upon by wine enthusiasts? Not necessarily for not following modern trends (like ultra ripe â€œboomerâ€ Napa cabs), but a real marked downturn in quality?"

I have roughly 40 bottles of wine, nothing insanely valuable, but some gems from Heitz, Dunn, etc from 2012-14. All of it is high-quality California or Oregon red wine that I hope to open in 5-20 years.

My fiancÃ© and I moved out of Denver this summer and left the wine in thermal fridge tote bags underneath a friends bed where itâ€™s roughly 69-71Â° in perpetuity and in the dark. We moved to Austin, and the moving company wouldnâ€™t take the wine. 

1) what damage is being done to the wine at that temperature? Itâ€™s been there three months. It is a mix of Pinot Noir and Cab Sauv
2) what is the most economical and safe way to get the wine to Texas?

The whole collection might be worth $5,000-7,000 - I am not really interested in high-end wine shipping, but I donâ€™t want to fly up to Colorado and rent a car to bring it down to Texas. I am considering securely packing it up and checking it on a United flight across 3-4 boxes. I am confident that a â€œfragileâ€ sticker and proper packing would ensure its safety on the plane to about 99%. I could also just tough it out and rent a car one-way and make the drive, costing me probably $600 in plane, gas, and car rental.

We drank one bottle later in our vacation in San Francisco, and brought some others home to the east coast. 

All these years later, we still had one bottle of that Late Harvest Symphony hanging around. After so many years, we assumed it had gone bad, but didnâ€™t want to toss it out, but also never had the desire to open it. 

Until tonight. 

Neighbors came over to celebrate my husbandâ€™s birthday, brought dessert, and I suggested this as the night we open the very old wine. And it wasâ€¦.

Not as bad as we expected! Not as good as we remembered, but it was drinkable. 

Still had faint traces of the apricot, peach, and pear we remembered. Lost the florals. Had some port-like notes. Not terrible for a 24-year old wine! Hats off to the winemaker. ðŸŽ©

"Self-afflicted psychological allergy of alcohol, possible?",0,1gdxicf,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gdxicf/selfafflicted_psychological_allergy_of_alcohol/,8,2024-10-28 15:59:37,"If this is not the subreddit for this, then I am sorry and this can be transferred/deleted. I only visit this subreddit and donâ€™t really know where else to post this, and this is something I am really struggling with.

Â 

I come from an environment where drinking is considered normal. This goes for not just my family, but basically everyone I grew up with. Parents of friends down the street, social gatherings like birthdays, diner parties. Ever since I was a kid, almost all the adults in my life drank alcohol. A considerable portion of the friends I have now, also like to drink. Not all are heavy drinkers, but if I am being honest it feels like I am verging on the edge of alcoholism myself and I know for a fact both my parents are and have been alcoholics for a long time.

Â 

What â€˜kept me in the darkâ€™ for a long time is that no-one around me really seemed to be compromised in their daily lives because of this life-style. Functioning addicts (not all of them, but still), so to speak. If I am being honest (again) I also donâ€™t see the problem in drinking whatever amount if itâ€™s someoneâ€™s choice and it doesnâ€™t come with harmful consequences for that person or his/her surroundings.

Â 

However, someone really close to me has developed a condition which really has damaged the way I view this person, and at time makes me want to cut him/her out of my life for good. Thus, the reason of this post.

Â 

Is it possible for some-one who has been drinking all his/her life to develop a sort of allergy of alcohol?

Â 

The person I am referring to may be having a pleasant conversation with you, but as soon as the first glass of wine is consumed things take a turn. The visual aspects of someone who is completely drunk are recognizable immediately (which is â€˜too soonâ€™) but even worse, the personâ€™s whole character seems to change. The same anecdotes are told back to back. Mean verbal jabs are made. His or her opinion on things are really extreme, but seem to be completely random, like the real â€˜he or sheâ€™ is completely gone.

Â 

It's just like the tolerance is completely gone, and a sort of super random auto-pilot takes over. I know it sounds like I am describing someone who is black-out drunk but like I said, this occurs after just one glass of wine, and this person has been drinking all his/her life. Can you drink away your tolerance to the point you are just a completely different person?"

How do I get into learning about red wine?,1,1gduusy,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gduusy/how_do_i_get_into_learning_about_red_wine/,9,2024-10-28 12:32:26,"Hello wine community.
Over the last year or so, Iâ€™ve really gotten into liking wines, reading about them and tasting them - but only whites. Mainly because I prefer whites, but also because I have an easier time distinguishing notes and differentiating the wines. I especially find Rieslings interesting, as the wines are incredibly versatile (I love crisp Riesling from Mosel, especially ones only harvested and made 1-2 years ago). NZ Sauvignons are also a favorite of mine (I prefer crisp, acidic, fruity and dry whites.) 

But reds just seem so much more difficult and hard to grasp? Where do I start? What grapes/areas? Also the notes and palates - for some reason I just do not find it as easy as smelling/tasting them on whites. How do I get going? 

I do drink reds - and like them - but the knowledge is very basic (I know I like Pinots). 

What would your tip be? How do I get good at reds. Thanks! ðŸ·"

Rocks district Syrah recommendations ,12,1gdsbqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gdsbqq/rocks_district_syrah_recommendations/,31,2024-10-28 09:55:33,"I recently had a couple bottles of Syrah from walla walla. The first was the base walla walla Syrah from Gramercy Cellars and the other was The Unnamed Series 2019 Syrah. I found both of these wines to be absolutely mind blowing. I am relatively new to wine and havenâ€™t developed great vocabulary for what I am tasting, but I loved how â€˜crispâ€™ the Gramercy Cellars was but still had a depth of darker fruit almost savory taste was. The Unnamed Series was great because it felt like over the course of the evening like I was drinking 3 separate wines. When I first opened it it had the same crispness I liked in the Gramercy bottle, but then changed to an almost smoky flavor. After about another hour the smoke gave way to a really delicious funky fruity wine. Really great stuff. 

All of this has made me extremely curious about other Walla Walla producers. My first question is: in my researching these bottles I have noticed people say rocks Syrah has a distinct funk. I am assuming thatâ€™s what I liked in the second bottle. Do other grapes besides Syrah exhibit this funky flavor from Rocks producers? My second question is i am looking for recommendations for wines similar to the ones i described. When I was trying to dig up different producers I ran across Cayuse and Reynvaan, both seem hard to find and expensive. I have also seen K Vintners and Rotie recommended, but not sure which make wines closer in style to those I have already enjoyed. I want to buy a half case direct from a winery that average out to about $50-60/bottle, but Iâ€™m not sure which to choose. Any help would be appreciated! "

I decided not to decant so I could watch the evolution a few ounces at a time. Immediately this gushed with vivid notes of blue fruitsâ€¦ think cocoa dusted blueberries & sappy cassis. With some air and time it began to reach equilibrium with notes of spice, glimpses of wet soil, loam, espresso grinds & milk chocolate. The structure was quite robust but completely velvety, this was gorgeous but the absolute icing on the cake came at the 2 hour mark when it really started to show a Rocky minerality & distinct notes of sea salt (think salted chocolate). Absolutely fabulous with a long, delicious life ahead.

V12 Cabernet,3,1gdoe0a,https://i.redd.it/mxq2m4t3wdxd1.jpeg,1,2024-10-28 06:32:15,"


2018 V12 Cabernet Sauvignon

Pulled and poured

Super rich jam, tobacco and a bit of dustiness on the nose initially, florals breaking through after 30-45 minutes in the glass

On the palate itâ€™s a bit muted to start, thereâ€™s some blackberry, tart cherries and some vanilla. Tannins are polished, plenty of acid here (probably from the hillside elevations of the vineyard) but not overwhelming, finish is long with toasty oak and spices, paired well with some Japanese bbq marinated flap loin cooked on the grill."

Cork was perfect, popped and poured but waited 15 mins - evolved in the bottle all evening. Still singing at 25 years- nose was floral, earthy and got some cherry and blackberry, minerals fading and finish not very long. But elegant and composed after so long for a Bourgogne. Says everything about the producer. 

With spicy Indian food you say, how inappropriate. This was only used during early appetizers, and have to say the spices counterintuitively did not overwhelm the wines. 

Confirmed yet again, Burgundy is all about the producer. I recall buying a case of this at under $50 a bottle long ago. Just a couple left, was worried its past its prime but definitely not so. "

Almost whenever I mention that I like Riesling, people say it is â€œtoo sweetâ€, even if I specify â€œdry Rieslingâ€. I understand if you donâ€™t like specific sweet varieties of wine like dessert wines or semi-sweet reds or whites, but every Riesling Iâ€™ve ever had was dry, and it seems most available are dry. 

I thought this was just an American thing that by imports/marketing Riesling has a reputation of being â€œsweetâ€. But even in Europe, people also seem to have this perspective in my experience.

Why is Riesling catching flak as â€œtoo sweetâ€ of a wine when there are many actually sweet wine varieties that donâ€™t seem to receive the same criticism?"

So fresh and precise still this could go longer easily.

Triolet 2020 - Less salinity and complexity, this was a challenging vintage. Similar lemon and lime but also a little grassy yet a little brighter than the 2015. Citrus galore on the palate, however feels thinner and less complex. 

Triolet 2022 - The standout for the Triolet here, this one is so well integrated. Has complexity beyond the 2015 and also tastes older than the 2015. Zippy yet creamy and well balanced. 2022 is a great vintage.

Chardonnay 2020 - Buttery and rich on the nose, refreshing salinity and yellow fruits. Still great complexity for this challenging year. 

Chardonnay 2021 - Like the 2020 but more fresh, more acidity and more fruit forward. A buffed up version of the 2020.

Chardonnay 2022 - Okay so what a vintage for the whites this is, so complex and drinking well beyond its years. This is a standout and so well integrated already, this would be exciting to revisit in 10 years. 

Marli Russell 2021 - A new endeavour by Mount Mary focusing on Rhone varieties grown and vinified at the estate. Big red fruit nose, core of strawberry and jam, smells like a farmers market. The palate is light and fresh with strawberry, cranberry, light as a feather, wow! Young Grenache vines so itâ€™s less concentrated fruit and lacks the earthiness you expect from a GSM. 

Marli Russell 2022 - This one has darker fruits, jammy plum and boysenberry, very brooding on the nose. Palate similar to the 2021 but more concentrated fruits. 

Pinot Noir 2021 - Very excited, my favourite Australian Pinot, feels like its weightless on the nose, dark red fruit core, porcelain on the palate itâ€™s so delicate, floats effortlessly with a trio of strawberry, slight pepper and vanilla pods.

Quintet 2014 - Deep and concentrated, blackcurrant and boysenberry with dried vanilla pods. Dark and ripe red fruits converging on a medium body. 10 years on and could still go a long way! 

Quintet 2017 - More liquorice and pronounced red fruits compared to the 2014, I get a little eucalyptus too. This one could almost fool me as Margaret River in a blind tasting. 

Quintet 2021 - Lost the eucalyptus note entirely, more earthy with deep red fruits with much more concentration. Excellent balance, great oak and vanilla perfectly integrated.

Quintet 2022 - More vanilla pronounced, thinner body on the palate but fresh and vibrant still with ripe red fruits."

In the privileged position of being a semi-retired physician with time including for travel, and have some capital. I would become a wine ""professional"" just to do this. I'm banned by my luckily more-sensible wife from starting or investing in a hobby winery so what else could I do to work or contribute to the wine world? I currently help a friend in her warehouse winery as needed but it needs to be a real role (i.e. 20+ hours a week). I'm in Australia.

It doesn't have to make money. I doubt the world needs more amateur wine writers. Ideas I've had... I could go in as an investor if a friend with industry experience starts a wine bar. Non profit? I have lots of contacts in the Middle East and could do something somehow helping winemakers in marginal areas?? Doing boutique imports is probably the easiest to initiate from a mechanical point of view but sounds capital-intensive, low and possibly negative margin and generally a pain in the ass unless I actually tried to scale it up. Would involve tax-deductible travel and probably good home drinking in direct proportion to sales failure but I'm under no illusions as to the glamour (my father shipped industrial material around the world and it seemed very painful).

Any ideas?

Paired well with spicy vegetarian nachos.

We are both fairly new to wine and haven't delved too much into the Old World. We loved how much we learned about the process and grew a much deeper love and respect for wine. 

The 1993 Vouvray, we only bought because that is our birth year and it was only 6â‚¬. It was the oldest white that I have had and it was a lot in the mouth. Tasted like I took a mouth full of dirt and chased it with some mushroom water. Definitely wasn't a favorite. 

We weren't in Bordeaux long, only 2 and a half days and only got one wine tour in at St. Emillion. I wish we would have been able to spend more time in this area as there was more things to see and wine to try than we had time for. 

This is the haul that we came home with. Our main goal was to get a bottle with the intention to save it for our 15 year anniversary. We chose the 2020 Chateau Martet. We loved this wine when we tried it at the shop. Had the tasting notes of dark cherry, vanilla, and licorice.

I've previously dabbled with home-brewing beer, and ""made"" a temperature controlled fermentation chambre using a tried and tested DIY approach: a fridge, with a small 60W tubular electric heater placed inside, the fridge and heater both wired into a thermostatic controller which turns one or the other on to maintain the temp within a set range. For home-brew this was around 19-21 degrees C, but it would be easy to adjust this to say 12-15 degrees C.

I'm wondering if something like this would work rather than spending Â£100's on a purpose-build wine fridge (esp. given the type/value of wine I'd be storing).

I did try searching around in the sub but the closest I found to an answer was talking about slowing/stopping the aging of the wine using a vacuum bag, which is not what I'm looking to do. I'm just trying to safely store it. I like in a pretty temperate climate, but our house will see some days in the 50s and some days in the high 80s and I don't have a basement."

First time trying old wine (Lafite 1988),136,1gckn96,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gckn96,40,2024-10-26 20:05:04,"Tried 3 different vintages of Lafite during the Decanter Masterclass in Singapore. 

2018 was very tight and tannic with primary fruits dominating both the aroma and palette. Can see how the wine will be elegant and great in the future. 

2008 was more advanced but still had great structure and started to show more softness but still had the primary fruit core. 

1988 was the one that made me go â€˜what the hell!?!?â€™ The first sniff I took almost made me gag. The barnyard funk was so strong that I thought I put my head into a pail of horse shit. Honestly, Iâ€™m not sure if this is representative of what older Bordeaux wines taste like. But it was quite revolting. The speaker remarked that we have to look past the barnyard funk to see the underlying tertiary notes. At this point, I was seriously questioning if the wine was corked or spoilt but it was my first time trying a 30+ yo wine and everyone around me didnâ€™t say anything so I didnâ€™t want to raise any questions lol. 

For those of you whoâ€™ve tried this vintage in recent years or have had experience with much older Bordeaux reds, is it common to have such a strong barnyard funk (smelling like horse shit)? Personally I didnâ€™t find it enjoyable so idk maybe itâ€™ll be something I have to experience more to appreciate. "

Slate and Shist rock battle for the grape vines of Pedro Xemenez and many other varietals. The people of the Duoro are lovely, hard working, life long devotees of their task, climbing these rocky slopes with wine baskets to harvest these grapes. 

After touring most of the wineries, my favorites are Sandemans and Dow, but other smaller, less well-known producers are also fantastic. 

I cook with 10 year tawny (pork with red wine vinegar, safe and port are my go-to) and drink 20 and 30 year tawny. 

If you love Port, make it a point to visit this beautiful region. It's well worth the long drive, side of the road, precipice gazing at the vertical slopes and amazing cellars of these vineyards. Cheers!

Ideal Wine Cellar Inventory According to Little's Law,22,1gcbvpu,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gcbvpu/ideal_wine_cellar_inventory_according_to_littles/,13,2024-10-26 10:13:37,"Little's law is a quick way to determine the optimal number of widgets in a process, whether it is a part in a manufacturing process, or a bottle in a wine cellar. 

The law says that the number of inventory items during steady state is equal to the average processing time (holding period) multiplied by the consumption rate.

Steady Inventory = Holding Period X Consumption Rate

For example. If I consume 52 bottles of wine per year, and I want to cellar each bottle for an average of 5 years, my ideal cellar inventory is 52x5=260.

More than 260 bottles means I won't consume enough before they age out, less than 260 means I'm consuming more than what my target holding period will allow. 

It's a simple way to perform a gut check for the ""how much is too much?"" question regarding how much wine to buy and cellar. "
The Wine List at Core by Clare Smyth seems a bit confused about Australia ,36,1gcbjf9,https://i.redd.it/b1ry6rp3m0xd1.jpeg,20,2024-10-26 09:53:01,"This map of Australia on page 65 of the wine list from 3-Michelin Star â€˜Core by Clare Smythâ€™ has bemused me for ages.

Besides putting Perth about 900km too far north, the map of Western Australia seems to think an area of mostly arid desert around the size of Italy is all wine-country (if only!). 

I sent an email about this years ago but - despite numerous revisions to the list - the map remains unchanged, and so does my minor irritation.

It lifted the oily/fishiness of the bonito. Might have clashed with the sweetness of the onion but otherwise an ideal pairing.

K&L left me a voicemail informing me they have refunded me in full. 

I was really happy to learn recently that K&L had a shipping affiliate that shipped to other states than CA. They're called RareStorage and the shipping rates seemed really reasonable. I filled up a couple cases of wine, paid for shipping and insurance and since then it has been a nightmare. 

They shipped my wine through GLS, who proceeded to drop my wine off in a different state than the one I live in. Now, nobody seems to know where it is, or when it will get to my house. K&L can't really help, although they have tried and their customer service is excellent, but RareStorage is a separate company. RareStorage won't talk to you on the phone and so you rely on email correspondence. They provided me with a new tracking number yesterday that was incorrect which further complicated things. I contacted GLS, who has assured me twice now that their operations team will contact me. That hasn't happened.

To K&Ls credit, they have really tried to help, but it seems their hands are tied. It also sounds like RareStorage uses different shipping companies for different states, so you could get lucky and have your wines shipped via UPS or Fed-Ex depending on your location. If you're considering having wines shipped through RareStorage, I would first inquire about which shipping company they'll use to get the wines to you. Also - for my state, there was not an overnight or 2 day shipping option. That probably should have raised red flags in itself, but by the time I realized that, it was too late. 

I know plenty of people here have had good experiences with K&L, and this really isn't their fault. But I did want to give the community a heads up that their affiliate is less commendable and your mileage may vary, depending on where you live. "

This beauty comes from the Eisenberg region of the southern Burgenland. Wachter-Wiesler are a well established producer from there, making BlaufrÃ¤nkisch in a terroir-driven style that focuses on refinement and freshness. The wine hails from the Weinberg vineyard in the village of Deutsch-SchÃ¼tzen. It has a souther exposition and its soil consists of iron rich clay. After spontaneous fermentation and spent 34 months in a large oak casks.

I aerated the wine for about 1 1/2 hours after opening and served it in a Spiegelau Definition Bordeaux glass. It has an opaque ruby colour and garnet rim.

On the nose the wine presents itself with dark fruity aromas at first, think of luxardo cherry, sloe and plum. Soon after, more savoury notes take control, hallmark notes of Eisenberg BlaufrÃ¤nkisch like blood and iodine come through immediately. The wine then also presents notes of crushed stones, undergrowth and black pepper. Furthermore, a well integrated hint of barnyard funk, citrus and earth envelope the wine.

The palate shows intense fruit of sloe and dark cherry at first, minerality and earthy notes come through as well. A very fresh acidity and structured, but not overpowering tannins add structure. A long finish brings the wine to an end, showing notes of luxardo cherry, meat juices, leather and herbal tones.

Another Eisenberg-banger after the Weninger Saybritz for me! It shows a perfect interplay of fruity, savoury and lightly spicy notes at this point of development. It also has still a lot of life still in it, so extended aging would also be an option. If you enjoy BlaufrÃ¤nkisch of this style, definitely give it a try!"

Very slight tannic grip from oak aging, and overall the oak here is forward but well integrated. Intensely long finish with green apple and white nectarine, toasty oak. After about 2 hours of air, additional secondary notes of toasted almonds and cinnamon come through towards the finish.

mouth: extremely silky, balanced, slightly warm, pronounced cherry, fresh vanilla, looong finish - creme brulee, vanilla, cherry. lasted 10 minutes if not longer

the finish specifically developed in my mouth - i wish we decanted!
97 pts - but i think if this was decanted it would reach 98

Mouton Rothschild 2005
dark and tawny color
nose: stewed fruit, some vanilla, toasted nuts
palate: fresh fruit on the edge of the palate that morphs into a somewhat stewed fruit on the center of the palate. still a good structure - this wine is in its early prime (for my palate) tannins are present and silky, but  leaves a grip that wants me wanting so much more.

97 pts - also probably needed a decant


Personally, â€˜09>â€™05, but they were both excellent.


Chateau Coutet Sauternes-Barsac 2008
nose: pear, citrus, ginger which allows the flavor to pierce through the nose
palate: the candied ginger is so awesome on this. it has all your classic sauternes notes, but the way the ginger makes this so unique has me really happy with this.
95 pts.

New Somm,4,1gbx4yx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gbx4yx/new_somm/,27,2024-10-25 22:36:20,"Hi all,

I'm looking for tips, tricks and/or tactics for remembering wine details. 

I have just started as a somm and am finding that it is difficult to get all the details locked down for the wines. I am expected to remember the winemaking and tasting notes for all of the BTG and Pairing wines but I keep getting things mixed up or just can't seem to lock it into memory.

 For example, Elk Cove Pinot Noir comes from 6 sites that are fermented separately in stainless steel and blended then matured in French oak for 10 months, using Pommard and Dijon clones. Then I'll have Hartford Court Chardonnay from Russian River Valley in Sanoma that is barrel fermented with 28% new French oak and aged for 9.5 months with weekly lees string and goes through full malolactic conversion. 

  
Two very different wines, made in very different ways but when I have to remember those details for 20, 30, 40 plus wines I find that I get aging times mixed up or the blend mixed up and so on, especially if the wines are similar. 

  
Wondering if anyone out there has ideas for how to get these things memorized. Event if its seems simple, I am just trying to pool different ideas I could adopt. 

  
Cheers 

From a Baby Somm"

Brunello Night in Malaysia ended with Tokaji & Pandan Swiss Roll ,3,1gbov7g,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gbov7g/brunello_night_in_malaysia_ended_with_tokaji/,2,2024-10-25 14:42:45,"tasted 3 brunellos at my friend's house over steak dinner 

  
Casanova di Neri & Tenuta Il Poggione were decanted for 2.5 hours before drinking and the Le ragnaie was poured out in the glass and we started drinking it after 45 mins .

to me the winner among these wines tonight is definitely the casanova di neri , come close at second place , le ragnaie 2019 which did not opened up as I hope during the night 

on the nose the 2018 casanova di neri is simply beautiful ,notes : plum , cherry , oaky , chocolate , tobacco , spice  , tannins are very well integrated .

ended the night with a bottle of Tokaji i brought back from my trip to Budapest , sold by Faust Wine Cellar . I have not tasted alot of tokaji or dessert wine , but this bottle is absolutely delightful to be paired with the pandan swissroll . perfect ending to the night

* Preference for blends over single varietal
* Aged whites are worth looking into for more interesting
* If it's some weird (not popular) grape variety, it's worth a shot
* I usually limit my regions and countries so I don't have too many variables so I can know what to expect a little more flavor wise - as regions within countries can be so different (like South Africa)
* Usually my budget is $20-35
* Avoid Cab Sav and Pinot Noir (cause under $30 is risky) - too many other reds to pick from

But seriously, has anyone else feeling like there's been a huge increase in noticeably whole cluster fermented/stem included pinot noirs lately? I know it's not a new technique by any means, but in my memory it used to be something that added an extra je ne sais quoi to a vintage that maybe needed some help with complexity, not hit you over the palate stem-y chewy. If the first thing I notice when tasting a pinot is if it's had stem contact or not, IMO it's gone too far. Specifically on American pinots, which I get a fairly broad exposure to through work, feels like recently the volume has been turned up to 11. Maybe my palate is just super sensitive to it and no one else is noticing this trend. Do I need to start a ABSCP (anything but stem contact pinot) club to join the ABC club?"

An enticing pale ruby colour. The nose is very aromatic with fruit cake, dried figs, cherry, and olive brine supported by an earthiness with some mushroom and lager.  

A light body with some light acidity right out the bottle complimented by very fine chalky tannins which dissipate over the second pour. Immediately getting sour cherries with strawberries and red currants. The secondary earthiness is also present with that great mushroom and cured meat which gives it that classic French savoury feel. Dark red fruits emerge with some air and are persistent through the finish.

My Mt. Etna experience and the regionâ€™s parallels with Burgundy,181,1gateoa,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gateoa,35,2024-10-24 10:31:16,"I just got back from Sicily for my honeymoon, and as part of the trip that I got to plan we visited two wineries: Benanti and Girolamo Russo. Both had fantastic wines with great tour guides/somms that took you through a flight of 5 or 6 of their wines. What made the latter visit extra special however was getting to experience some of the harvest of their Nerello Mascalese grapes. 
As you might know, things go a little differently in Europe and you canâ€™t just stop by unannounced at the tasting room, you need to email them and reserve a time slot for a good 2-3 hr or longer experience likely to be paired with multiple courses and/or walks through the vineyard. 
Benantiâ€™s wines and historic production house turned modern showcase are impressive, with a large old wooden press and art adorning the rooms that had a sort of royal, medieval vibe to them, only surrounded by lava rocks. We tasted a beautiful sparkling metodo classico brut Rosato (that they no longer make or at least sell and distribute past 2020), a contrada bianco, a 10 yr old Nerello Cappuccio, and 2 more reds including a 2011 Serra Della Contessa, probably their most prized vineyard boasting centenarian vines behind the property on the side of a SE facing hill. This was all paired with thoughtfully paired food courses for each person. We didnt have the Pietra Marina, but I left with two 2019s after reading and hearing first hand how ageworthy it is.
Girolamo Russo is a newer winery with their own unique story that I wonâ€™t get into here, but the tour was incredibly special. The woman leading our experience let us work the sortable table before taking us through each of their main vineyards by having us follow in our rental car within the different contrade, or sub zones. We eventually walked up to their current tasting room if you can call it that, for their entire lineup including a metodo classico and pet-nat I didnâ€™t know they made. All these wines were just as impressive, each having their own character depending on the contrada they represented. 

After touring the vineyards I remember being struck by all parallels to Burgundy: the lava rock walls surrounding all the vineyards, much like a clos; thereâ€™s many different producers working in the same contrada, and Mt Etnaâ€™s wines are extremely elegant and mineral, with red and white expressions made from mostly single varietal grapes (especially the higher end bottles). I even remember thinking I could totally mistake Girolamo Russoâ€™s San Lorenzo Bianco for a high quality 1er cru Chablis. When I mentioned some of this to our somm she replied, â€œyou know they call it the Burgundy of the South!â€ She wasnâ€™t kiddingâ€”after looking back at the World Atlas of Wine, Jancis Robertson says â€œSome see it as the new CÃ´te dâ€™Or, and vine holdings are similarly parcellated.â€ 
Thereâ€™s a lot incredible wine there, with many relatively newer wineries tending some diverse and exciting terroir. And if you love bubbles, especially rose, thereâ€™s amazing QPR to be had there too! Vintage bottles of metodo classico brut rosato aged on its lees for 2-3 years can be found everywhere in shops for â‚¬25-30"

Poggio di Sotto Brunello di Montalcino 2017

Decanted and drank over two hours. 

My first experience with this legendary Brunello producer and it did not disappoint.

2017 has an unfair rep as a ""bad"" vintage, but I think 2017 Brunello from good producer is still good Brunello and, very importantly, pretty ready to drink now. This isn't for aging over decades (save that for the 2016s and 2019s).

Initially pretty tannic, but with air, really opened up.

Notes of red cherry, red plum, chestnut, soil. Over time, the fruit notes came to the forefront.

Really lovely wine that could benefit from further aging, but is already approachable.

93 points.

Daniel Rion & Fils Vosne-Romanee Les Chaumes 1er Cru 2017

Ready to drink now. Needs a little air, but not heavy decanting (although I did decant it).

Very fruit-forward Bourgogne, ripe fruit, bright cherry notes. 

Nose is almost perfumey with floral notes of rose and cherry blossom. Almost reminds me of my wife's perfume. 

Drinking lovely now.

Very fun experience and would drink both again any day of the week! "

Explosion of red berries on the nose. Like a smoothy of raspberries that is deliciously inviting. Background notes of sagebrush and dessert shrubs but really the raspberries stole all my attention.

On the palate, you immediately think bright red fruits that give a full mouth feel but without making you exhausted with it being a typical CA red wine. It was bright and lovely and balance with a nice acidity. The finsih went on for days, like a treat.

Overall it's a classy example of Anderson Valley pinot noir. Really love to drink on its own but I snacked on some charcuterie and truffle cheese, which was perfect.

94/100. I regret I didn't pick up a second bottle. 

Hard not to smile while drinking and Anderson Valley pinot and this had me ear to ear.

Are Vinotemp wine fridges still considered a good budget pick?,6,1gamejh,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1gamejh/are_vinotemp_wine_fridges_still_considered_a_good/,7,2024-10-24 04:49:28,"I saw this 157-bottle Vinotemp for sale at Lowe's for just $630 - nothing seems to be even close to that price for a similar capacity. I'd heard some reports of failure after a couple years in general for this brand, but I'd think any brand besides Eurocaves carries that risk - if it lasts even 6-8 years I'd consider it a win for this price. The side-loading bottle layout could also be problematic for some bottle sizes, but even staggering bottles the capacity should be sufficient for the price.

I'm from Germany, specifically from the Riesling region, where wine is a big part of the culture. Funny enough, I noticed pretty early on that I can't really handle wine. Where Iâ€™m from, itâ€™s common to mix white wine with water to make a refreshing spritzer, so I didn't think much about it growing up since it was always diluted.

As I got older, I moved away from white wine and started trying red wines, but soon switched almost entirely to beer after spending some time in Bavaria. Now Iâ€™ve realized that whenever I have just one glass of wine, it gives me stomachaches and gastrointestinal issues that last through the next day. At first, I thought maybe it was an alcohol thing, but I can drink two liters of beer without any problems.

Has anyone else experienced this? Could there be something specific in wine that causes these issues? Or is it possible that beer, with its anti-inflammatory compounds, helps counteract the effects of alcohol on my stomach?

Any insights would be appreciated!
