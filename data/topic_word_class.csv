1go438u,wine,"Thanks for helping me drink a 50 year cab I posted last year about buying a 50 year old wine.  After your suggestions, I found one from an online auction and bought it.  Living in the ""great"" state of Alabama, I had to have it shipped to a package store where they could charge me 29cents extra in taxes.   So weird.    You also suggested that a 50 year old cab would likely not be very good and to have a backup bottle, so I went to the store and without realizing it, bought another cab from the same vineyard.  So we had a bottle from 1974 and 2020.  Fortunately, the 74 was actually pretty good.  The color had faded a bit, and it had lost ""something"", but otherwise was enjoyable.  I would equate it to listening to a song and turning the bass all the way down.  You know what you are listening to and you might even start hearing a couple things you wouldn't have noticed normally, but there is definitely something missing.  Anyway, thanks for the help, it went very well!

Also, not as comprehensive as Iâ€™d like as well.

1goekwq,wine,"The cooked wine experiment  Ever wonder what would happen if you left wine in a 110 degree room for 11 days? Well, let me tell you because this is exactly what happened to our friendsâ€™ wine. 

Their house had to go through water remediation and part of the process was to blast their basement with hot air machines, which unfortunately cooked all their wine. While the wine wasnâ€™t anything high end or fancy, there were certainly a couple of bottles which I was familiar with that I was definitely sad to hear were ruined. 

Nothing turned into vinegar or tasted like stewed fruits surprisingly. The main theme was that pretty much all of them tasted flat and smelled like nothing. They werenâ€™t disgusting, just veryâ€¦blah. Meh. Pretty much flavorless. 

The only exception was the 19 Crimes. It was terrible, but that probably wasnâ€™t due to the heat. The heat did seem to kill the nose, but I picked up some weird root beer, sarsaparilla, cream soda, cola note, definitely like fake sugary kind of note. 

On the palate, it was some kind of caramel and Dr Pepper with a hint of cherry robitussin. I almost spit it out because it was so nasty. 

It was honestly kind of exciting how bad it was, considering everything else was so flat. If youâ€™ve heard of movies that are so bad theyâ€™re good, this was almost like that, but with wine, and it wasnâ€™t actually good. But it was fun making fun of the 19 Crimes wine and very educational to taste the other wines that had been damaged by heat.

Oh - the Prosecco honestly wasnâ€™t too bad either, but La Marca isnâ€™t great to begin with, so the bar was pretty low, but it still had good fizz and didnâ€™t taste all that noticeably worse than a normal bottle!

We're planning to do  Seghesio and Jordan in Healdsburg on Friday, as we have friends who work at both tasting rooms, but would love to see 1-2 more places on Friday before we head back to Santa Rosa for dinner. 

Additionally, our Saturday is completely open to suggestions after going to Armstrong Reserve around 9 AM to see Redwoods, and if needed, we can do 1-2 wineries on Sunday before heading back to the East Bay. Happy to do Healdsburg again on Saturday or try a different region. Very agnostic on types of wine, and we have a car and will of course Uber responsibly.

For Healdsburg in particular, these were the suggestions we received from friends that we could use help paring down.

* Reeve 
* Hawkes 
* Amista 
* Marine Layer

Petrus 1970.  Mid low shoulder fill.  Insanely depressed cork. I want so bad for this to be a miracleâ€¦

Haut Brion 1974 - Iâ€™d bet everything that this is toast. Never seen such low ullage. Iâ€™m still gonna open it up and smell it. Who knows? The bottle is a really interesting shape. 

Weingut Dr. Alex Senfter - nierfteiner Orbel Riesling Beerenauslese 1976 - this one has a nice looking level, but brown glass makes it hard to tell whatâ€™s inside.  Kinda have some hope for this one..

Beaulieu Vineyard private reserve 1971 - if only the petrus had the fill level of this one.  Decent cork and capsule position. Cellar tracker notes are not inspiring, but Iâ€™d be glad to open this up for science.

Porto Barros 1890 - I started shaking when I picked this one up haha. Not too familiar with ports this old.  The wax on the capsule is super crusty looking. The fill level is right to the top of the shoulder.  I have pretty high hopes for this one.

Offley Vintage Port 1963 - upper mid shoulder fill. Cork seems a little depressed.

I'm a burgundy noob, so take my notes with a grain of salt.

Chateau De La Tour

Nose: Very balanced between red fruit, earth, tiny amount of spice, and a dusty note.

Palate: Very complex. Notes of spce, like black pepper, leather, tobacco, hints of red fruit. Very balanced. Also one unique note I can't describe, but it wasn't something I'm used to. Very high concentration of flavor, medium-high body

Finish: medium tannins, strong leather, dark chocolate, spice in the initial finish

Nicolas Rossignoe

Nose: More earthy on the nose, not much fruit, spice

Palate: Similar to the nose, earthy, leather, black pepper. Less concentration than the previous, slightly watery, but still very good.

Finish: Low tannins, but still present, slight amoumt of dark chocolate bitterness, good length

Two very good wines overall. I preferred the De La Tour, but these are basically my first two burgundies ever. Normally, we drink bordeaux, barolo, chianti, or Rioja and occasionally some new world wines, but not much Pinot in general.

1gmy0tb,wine,"2019 Mommessin CÃ´te-du-Brouilly Grandes Mises | More Cru! More Cru! Continuing my journey into Cru Beaujolais, I went to my favorite local shop and snapped up a few examples of the other 10 Crus, especially those lesser known ones - including this five year old Cote-de-Brouilly at $25. Wasnt familiar with the producer, but plenty of available info!Grapes harvested on September 7, 2019 - then 15 months ageing on fine lees. Stored at 55, popped and poured - no decanting. Paired with a grilled salmon and some rice.

Visually, a strong ruby color, hints of purple at the edge. Beautiful color.

On the nose, I went in expecting the usual red fruits of a gamay - was incredibly surprised to pick up herbs and spices reminiscent of the Southern Rhone! Less flowers than I expected. Deeper into the glass, blueberries - with a hint of the usual strawberries and cherries I expected. Fantastic scents for a gamay, I'm sure partly thanks to the terroir of this Cru.

On the palate - medium bodied, yet still refreshing to drink. A pleasant tannin grip, perhaps I should've aired it out a little - yet balanced, with a good bit of acidity. No notable burn at all (label shows it as 11-14% ABV? Wild LOL. Never seen an abv >range< before.) Dry. Flavors of blackberry pie, blueberry jam - bit of pepper at the tail end. The herbs continue - a fantastic bit of complexity at the price point. Nice long finish. This was $25?

My first Cote-de-Brouilly, and I'm absolutely blown away here. The nose, the palate - fantastic value here. Delicious in every way, and I cant wait to track down other producers.

Great communication, and we ended up spending nearly three hours there. Seeing their horses, cellar, production facility, historic home, and vines was one of the highlights of our trip. The clarets and field blends were great and extremely interesting blends. The work theyâ€™ve done on their property and vines is evident in the product and the passion for what theyâ€™re doing. They were even kind enough to share what was left of a 92 vintage Niepoort (a birth year for several of us). 

We ended up buying several bottles and left with a few gifts from u/aligotegozaimasu as well! Their hospitality and kindness was above and beyond, and we couldnâ€™t have been more thankful for the time they spent to show us their work.

1gn59mk,wine,"Objective criteria for wine quality Hey r/wine! One thing that's been occupying my idle brain since ages is defining objective criteria for wine quality. Not a single score, definitely not a list of aromas and flavors, but relatively easily measurable characteristics that would correlate with the ""quality"", i.e, serve as a buying guideline for an intelligent but not-very-well-versed-in-wine-yet human.

Say, my wife sees Chateau TrouvÃ© for 20$, Chateau Perdu for 200$, and Chateau Ã‰garÃ© for 35$ in a shop. She checks the notes and they are like ""... minty-edge to the cedar, tobacco, cigar box..."", ""... dried roses, mint, tobacco, dried cherries..."", ""... mint, smoke, cherries and raspberries..."" â€” absolutely unhelpful for her to make a choice (she grabs the one with the nicest label or the one with more medals). What I think would help her, or some redditors here, to make an informed decision, is to mention that, say, the bottle of Ã‰garÃ© for 35 bucks is better balanced and is a bit more complex than TrouvÃ© for 20$.

Not sure asking AI helps (yet?). For example, Gemini seems to care more about classification, reputation, and critic reviews, not to mention it often gets basic facts wrong.

With that, here are a few of my criteria to seed the discussion:

* Balance, both in main compounds (acid, alcohol, sugar, polyphenols) and in taste perception

* Duration of the aftertaste

* Complexity of the story the wine tells, e.g., ""light and fruity nose but surprisingly deep note of cherry that evolves into whatnot and becomes thisthat...""

1gmqth4,wine,"2020 Domaine de Leyre-Loup Fleurie | Too much Cru Beaujolais, not enough time! Purchased a bottle to go along with dinner at a local wine bar, No Reservations, in Miami - was in the mood for some Cru Beaujolais when I walked in, so happy to see it on the menu! Paired with grilled lamb chops. Served a little cold (felt like 35-40), but warmed up as the night went on - not decanted.

Visually, a strong purple color - once I put my flash to it!

On the nose, bountiful floral scents at the rim - a bouquet of lovely fresh flowers on a spring day. Deeper into the glass, strong notes of ripe strawberries and cherries. Took a bit to open up - but I pin that more on the serving temperature than anything.

On the palate, fantastically crisp and refreshing, especially chilled. Lightly bodied, pleasant acidity, barely any notable tannin grip - par for the course with the grape. Dry, with perceived sweetness due to the strong ripe red fruit flavor more so than any actual sugar. That same nose of cherries and strawberries resumed on the palate, bountiful red fruit. Delicious, albeit no real complexity of flavor to me. Decent finish, and a great pairing with the lightly seasoned lamb and vegetable salad.

The bottle went for $58, but the host reduced it to $29 for me, and for a restaurant bottle at that point, I was definitely very satisfied with the value (since $58 gets me some good Big 4 Morgon). Took half the bottle home where it promptly didn't survive the night. Will happily continue pursuing Fleurie and the other Crus (eyeing a particular Cote de Brouilly for tonight)! Looking up the producer online, I was happy to see them using very sustainable and organic farming methods, which will have me choose them again soon. Recommended!

So far I've explored a bunch of red wines and figured out what I **don't like:**

1. Heavy, full, overly sweet reds (e.g. a lot of California reds like Zinfandel/Cabs)

2. Musty, chocolate, spicy, earthy tones

  
What I **do like:**

1. Lighter wines (leaning dry, but some amount of sweetness is nice)

2. Love love the chillable red wines

3. Floral/fruity scent/taste but not toooo sweet

4. Generally, I've found that the wines I like have a translucent/transparent reddish color? (like a french pinot/gamay?)

1gmjqhm,wine,"Food permits in the wine world  There are a lot of wine tasting rooms where I live in California. They all do different things.  Some offer wines by the glass, then another just a couple doors down says they canâ€™t serve wines by the glass. Some serve cheese and oysters, and some only serve cut bread for palate cleansers or nothing at all.

Out of curiosity, I researched online if there are any licenses involved. As you might expect, I got a lot of different answers, but no real final say.
I did find some sources claiming that wine is considered food and, therefore, you need full-on food licensing.

So at what point does a wine tasting room need a food license?  Does anyone with experience in tasting rooms have the answer?

1glzze5,wine,"Mousiness in Wine - Would you send a bottle back? If so, when? Hello everybody,

just had a lovely meal in Paris with a bottle of wine that was pleasant to start, but unfortunately became noticeably mousey within 45 minutes. I'm more than open to natural wines, and have served and sold many, but typically I'm more used to wines that turn around the second day mark and was unpleasantly surprised that this was so noticeably faulty before the mains even hit the table.

This got me thinking about the changes in the dynamics of wine consumption and how the industry reacts to it. The whole process of tasting a wine prior to serving is focused on cork taint... So while working as a Somm, I would accept a return from a guest where the cork taint became prominent over time (ie not noticed immediately upon serving to the guest), I don't know how I would feel about a wine that became mousey over the course of a meal... Conversely, as a guest, I didn't feel comfortable returning a wine that had become mousey (even though it happened so fast).

I feel like I'm rambling a bit, but I'm curious - if you're eating in a restaurant, under what circumstances would you return a bottle of wine that had gone mousey? Do you think mousiness is given more of a ""free pass"" than other taints? And if so, do you think thats fair?

Hopefully I'm not opening a can of worms here but I'm interested. Both as someone who is neither staunchly pro or anti natural wine, but also as a consumer who is usually on the other side of the interaction.

Appreciate your insights. Cheers.",0.042,0.778,0.181,0.9918,not_negative,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Quintessa: known for its long history of organic/biodynamic winemaking practices. 91% Cab Sauv and 60% new French oak. Dark berry fruit and granular, smooth tannins. Great acidity. 

Ornellaia: Bolgheri blend of 62% Cab Sauv, 31% Merlot, and a dappling of Petite Verdot and Cab Franc. Chalky tannins, earthy, tomato vine, and a jab of VA that improved with time in the glass. This one needs the most time to show itself out of all the wines tasted today. 

Chateau Mouton-Rothschild: lots of green bell pepper up front that integrated better with time in the glass. Angular, muscular, lots of personality.

 However when the temperature drops and it attempts to heat something is going wrong and the unit is tripping my mcbs on the electrical distribution board.

Weighty and sweet but had substantial acid to back it up. Over time it got a bit more subdued on acidity and came really into balance and opened up to where I feel it was ideal after around an hour or so open. Towards the end of the bottle it did begin to lean a little bitter and flabby as it had started falling off.

1gkosej,wine,"2009 Drouhin Oregon Chardonnay REVIEW Updating from an earlier post, with my first review here on r/wine! 

Iâ€™ve slowly gotten into the wine world over the last few years, and working in the fine dining industry, Iâ€™m lucky to be exposed to a lot of higher level bottles and people who are amazing and willing to share. My first epiphany moment with wine, the sip that turned on the light bulb, was a 2010 Roulot white burgundy. I was so intrigued and so thrown off by the amount of flavors and textures and feelings that the wine thrust upon me, I didnâ€™t know how to react. Following this experience, I was sent into a two year foray into white burgundy and have found myself with significantly lighter pockets since. As an avid drinker of Nebbiolo and lover of Italy, I had sworn France to be overrated and dull. Boy, did this day prove me wrong! 

Ive been chasing that dragon since, and landed on Meursault and Pouilly-Fuisse, or more southern burg whites as my palettes choice due to the richness, creaminess, and more oak, as opposed to higher acid and steely-clean, crisp Chablis counterparts. 

Today, we have a bottle that intrigued me when I saw it, excited me when I got home and did some research, and blew my mind when I opened it. 

2009 Drouhin â€œArthurâ€ Oregon Chardonnay, found this among 4-5 more, covered in dust in a south Florida liquor store. Hereâ€™s my novice review so we can all get this over withâ€¦

Med-deep gold color, almost amber, gold flake and perfectly hued. Intense nose, flooded with deep, rich, and creamy apple orchard notes, little bit of flint, lot of brown butter and seriously (SERIOUSLY) heavy popcorn, but it was so good, no chemical traces, just organic pure old butter. Insanity. Wine was dry, weighty, but so well integrated, little bit of tannin (from oak maybe?) but it was so dang smooth. Medium acid, high alcohol, full body, intense flavor, crazy long finish.

My HVAC let go in my cellar on Nov 1; coolant was leaking from my fan.

I was storing at 14C (57F) and it raised to 22C (72F) as of Monday (Nov 4).

HVAC company is coming by a week later (Nov 8).

Will my wine degrade at these temps if they were exposed for only a couple of days as well as the temperature increase was gradual and not thermal shock?

Really fresh tasting, stereotypical fruits for Pinot, cleaner style with little forest floor or mushroom character. Bien nacido hitching post was much denser and more complex on red fruit with flavors of pomegranate showing through. The lâ€™enclos was drinking at an absolute peak. Outstanding persistence, good varietal character, just crunchy enough to let you know thereâ€™s cab franc and have it be a feature, still had a really lush red plum character without feeling overblown, great tension.

The 2016 lâ€™enclos was insurance and not opened.


For food, I made beech mushroom toasts with magic dust seasoning from the hitching post and a red wine reduction. Those were aimed at the Pinots and paired well.

1gjonqf,wine,"Visiting Jerez - Field Report & Recommendations With Sherry Week kicking off today, I wanted to share my experience and recommendations from a trip to the incredible region of Jerez in early October.

**Background**: Iâ€™m based in Poland and got interested in Sherry two years ago through WSET 2. Earlier this year, I completed an intermediate course by Consejo Regulador Vinos de Jerez. I donâ€™t speak Spanish.

**Getting There**: Reaching Jerez is surprisingly easy. While thereâ€™s a small airport, taking the train is likely the simplest route, either from Madrid (\~4 hours) or Seville (\~1 hour).

**Getting Around**: The key bodegas (wineries) are in Jerez, SanlÃºcar de Barrameda, and El Puerto de Santa MarÃ­a. A convenient bus from Jerez (near the train station) goes to SanlÃºcar, and thereâ€™s a quick train to El Puerto. Iâ€™d advise against renting a carâ€”Sherry is fortified, and one tasting alone can be potent! Public transport is reliable, so thereâ€™s no need to drive.

**Arrival in Jerez**: We arrived in Jerez on a Sunday and stayed at a comfortable, reasonably priced accommodation booked through Booking. October wasnâ€™t crowded with tourists, and the weather was fantastic. The city is compact, very walkable, and filled with beautiful architecture. I wish I had more time to explore, but of course, the main goal was to drink Sherry!

The city is full of bars, particularly â€œtabancosâ€ (Sherry bars), where a glass ranges from 1â‚¬ to 5â‚¬. The quality is usually great, though there are occasional misses.

**Dining at La CarbonÃ¡**: On our first night, we had a reservation at La CarbonÃ¡ (https://maps.app.goo.gl/mJ411xqBpQS7KJ9X7), recommended by this subreddit. We chose the â€œLola CarbonÃ¡â€ tasting menu, which was 75â‚¬ per person and included 7 dishes paired with 7 different Sherries. Though there were some minor slip-ups (a shell in the seafood and limited English), the experience was a fantastic start to our trip.

**Exploring SanlÃºcar de Barrameda**: Early the next day, we took the bus to SanlÃºcar, a smaller seaside town with plenty of charm. Our first stop was Bodegas Hidalgo la Gitana (https://bodegashidalgolagitana.com/), which was incredible! The cathedral-like bodega building was awe-inspiring, and the tour was both informative and fun. For 19,50â‚¬, we tasted four Sherries, including two drawn directly from barrels with a traditional *venencia*. You even get to keep a branded glass as a memento. We left with a bottle of their Manzanilla Pastrana.

Afterward, we wandered to Bodegas ArgÃ¼eso (https://maps.app.goo.gl/YGtMGLEBheHYvbbP8) for a quick, free tasting in their shop. It was a good experience, though language was a bit of a barrier.

Our walk to Bodega Delgado Zuleta (https://maps.app.goo.gl/GXaJk9PvhGrDHRr29) led us to a pleasant surprise at Bodegas BarÃ³n (https://maps.app.goo.gl/zrCPuwmoGh5c84Vj9). Despite the language gap, the friendly staff gave us an impromptu tasting directly from the barrels. We ended up buying a bottle of their Manzanilla Pasada.

At Delgado Zuleta, we didnâ€™t have a reservation, but a kind staff member offered us a small free tasting. We sampled five or six different Sherries and bought a bottle of their Amontillado.

After a day full of tasting, we enjoyed a meal at Taberna der Guerrita (https://maps.app.goo.gl/qdwEh9vkcw4D6nuC6), another spot recommended here. The tapas were incredible, andâ€”perhaps inspired by all the Sherryâ€”we accidentally ordered bullâ€™s testicles! Also, be sure to check out their *trastienda*, a shop filled with Sherries.

**Sherry Museum at Bodegas Barbadillo**: We wrapped up SanlÃºcar with a stop at a small museum in Bodegas Barbadillo, which is worth a visit. Naturally, there was another tasting in the shop before we headed back to Jerez with five bottles in my backpack.

**Flamenco Night in Jerez**: That evening, we went to Tabanco El Pasaje (https://maps.app.goo.gl/WdU6Vhakca2TxiA4A) for a flamenco show. Although itâ€™s a popular tourist spot, the ambiance was great. We ordered a premium tapas set and enjoyed a house Amontillado that was so good we ordered another. The show itself was intense at first but very captivating.

**Touring the Iconic Bodegas**: The next morning, we visited Bodegas Lustau (https://lustau.es/en/) for a 30â‚¬ tour that included 7 Sherries (one VORS) and a vermouth. It was an amazing experience, and we bought a VORS bottle.

Later, we went to the renowned Bodega Tio Pepe (https://www.tiopepe.com/es-es/reserva). While the 24,90â‚¬ tour (4 Sherries included) was enjoyable, it felt a bit commercial with amusements like ""Sherry train ride.""

**Bodegas TradiciÃ³n**: Our final day began at Bodegas TradiciÃ³n (https://bodegastradicion.es/), which was absolutely outstanding. We received a private tour (as we were the only guests that day) with Ãgueda, who adapted her guidance to our deeper knowledge of Sherry. Afterward, we explored the ownerâ€™s private art collection, featuring Spanish masterpieces by artists like El Greco, VelÃ¡zquez or Goya. The tasting included two VOS, three VORS, and one Fino, all truly exceptional. This premium experience costs 55â‚¬ per person but is absolutely worth it.

**Final Stops**: Our last stop was Bodegas Fundador (https://brandyfundador.com/visita-bodega/), a large-scale bodega with a 30â‚¬ tour featuring three VORS. Afterward, we visited Vinos y Licores La Estrella (https://maps.app.goo.gl/aSXtcEMo37nSkkkr7) for a few final bottles before attempting a visit to the Consejo Regulador (https://maps.app.goo.gl/T7bcD9ZfdCJCZUh58), which, unfortunately, was closed during declared opening hours.

**Final Thoughts**: My trip to Jerez was unforgettable, and Iâ€™ll definitely be backâ€”maybe even next year. The region and its wines seem vastly underrated, which keeps prices affordable. And I still need to explore El Puerto!

**Bonus Tips**: If youâ€™re nearby, consider visiting Cadiz (a short train ride) and Seville. In Cadiz, GorriÃ³n (https://maps.app.goo.gl/NKt4MntEayq4EUfV7) is a great wine bar, while Baco Vinos (https://maps.app.goo.gl/mVEAHMfmXMtF8b3A8) is a well-stocked shop with English-speaking staff. Taberna La Manzanilla (https://maps.app.goo.gl/K9g5NUCgbu8VtzGj9) serves exclusively Sherries, many aged to VOS or VORS but declassified. In Seville, Vinoteca Lama La Uva (https://maps.app.goo.gl/55yxN3KHdSAu3o137) has an excellent selection and very kind, English-speaking owner, and Bar Casa Morales (https://maps.app.goo.gl/uxGHgZuVVxHSjUhQA) offers affordable, authentic, delicious experiences (the secret to get inside is to try all three different entrances).

Cheers, folks! Enjoy your Sherryâ€”not only this week!

1gjndkh,wine,"Balade oenologique tasting package This is a tasting package of samples of BIO French wines. It's a blind tasting, you can read what you drank afterwards and they also provide tasting notes in French(see last images). I wrote my tasting notes before reading theirs, seems like for some of them we agreed for others not so much :) . First wine is no. 2, I forgot to take a picture of wine 1, it looked pretty similar to no 2 if a bit lighter maybe.

Wine 1
Sweet, apricot smell on the nose, as well as a bit of yeasty character and floral notes.
On the palate, quite acidic, and somewhat fruity, citrus with a bit of pear and apricot. Yeasty character persists on the palate.
Finish is more yeasty than anything else, lingering for a bit.

Wine 2
On the nose, pretty fruity, I think peach, yeasty notes here as well. The fruit persists on the palate, with a bit of a subtle thyme and oregano note going on as well, with the yeasty character here too. It also reminds me a bit of maybe a very fresh fruit tart? I don't know how to put it better. Quite savory, the finish is somewhat short. An interesting wine

Wine 3
A rose wine. On the nose, I'm honestly not getting much except for a slight floral note. On the palate, it's fruity, maybe some sort of red forest fruit, but again somewhat faint. The finish is surprisingly long and powerful, much more clear redcurrant than when you just taste it first. 

Wine 4
The first red wine. This is a light red wine, with musky and floral notes on the nose. Quite acidic, with light tannins. Body is thin. Definitely looks like Pinot Noir. I'm getting notes of cherry, plum and some almost tomato like savory note. In enjoyed this wine.

Wine 5

A much more corpolent red wine. On the nose, forest floor and redcurrant. Moderate acidity and tannins. Quite pleasant, easy-drinking but still somewhat powerful. I'm getting redcurrant and just berries in general. A bit of dried plum as well, especially on the finish. Finish is quite prolonged. 

Wine 6

A dark red wine. Pretty strong eucalyptus on the nose. Besides that, I'm also getting an almost cherry cola like note on the nose. Moderate acidity and somewhat strong tannins. The eucalyptus persists on the palate, being however complemented by cherry as well as dark fruit notes, such as blackcurrant and I think blackberry. Quite savory, long finish. Quite a complex wine, I really enjoyed this one.

1gjp4q4,wine,"Have you ever advised, inserted yourself, or helped out an aging person with their wine collection? TL;DR - have you advised or helped out any aging wine collector population on the need to ""move"" wines, drink them, or get rid of stuff before it ages out? Even my healthy and hip Dad at 80 has a collection that isn't moving as fast, and I suspect we're seeing stuff die, and I feel like I should involve myself a bit.

\---------

I've worked my whole career in food and beverage in kitchens and front of house, then rooms ops and hospitality, eventually leading to design/build stuff, all since 1995. I've seen builds and helped with some wine rooms, in ideal and not so ideal situations. Then you move on... and old school inventory control still meant directors would ignore / miss some wine, or not sell it so it ages out and is no longer good. That's a bummer. It wasn't under my management, but I've seen some pretty stellar wine inventories get into disarray. It breaks your heart to see stuff turn or get ignored.

That being said, I notice baby boomers are both not traveling, nor eating or drinking, like they used to. Their cellars are full, and it's part of the ding the industry is having in re-inventing, modernizing, reaching new audiences, and competing with this temperance movement, weed, and interest in seltzers (the new Zima, Bartles and James, Smirnoff Ice, and this too shall pass). But they can't rely on boomers to buy, with as full as some of those cellars are!

But I do think there are a lot of personal collections that are turning. I mean, I'm 48 and I'm shocked what the pandemic did to my brain and time... I keep thinking a bunch of my collection is just 3 to 5 years old, and all of a sudden it's 15 years old, etc. So I realize there's a bunch of baby boomer collections that aren't being drunk as rapidly, and there are absolutely a bunch of cellars all over the world that just has turning or dead wines, and I want to know if any of you have done anything to prevent that?

I don't mean pilfering or self-interest, but have any of you helped a parent or friend by auditing a collection and sort of organizing what should be drunk or at least considered before it expires? How'd it go? 

I think this question might be extremely silly, so I might delete. Just curious if people have started seeing wine collections get ignored, sort of abandoned, and good stuff turning over time. Cheers all.

I learned that Pedernales Cellars makes wine from grapes that are grown in their own vineyard, so I picked up a bottle of their 2021 tempranillo, made some chili, and poured me a glass.

This wine had a garnet color with a vivid ruby rim. I picked up notes of black cherries, peppercorn, and cedar with a hint of flint.

1givkes,wine,"2020 Sauvion Vouvray | More delicious $15 Chenin Blanc  Ah, Chenin Blanc from the Loire. My go-to reliable whites for casual drinking. I can never say no to a bottle when I'm out searching for more bottles, and at a comfortably priced $15 at my local wine shop, an easy purchase to try out a new producer. Stored at 45, popped and poured - to note, it's a screwcap! Sipped sans pairing on the first night, paired with grilled chicken and potatoes on day two.

On the nose, faint floral scents at the rim - honeysuckle and citrus blossom. Further in, familiar notes of grapefruit, lemon - surprisingly no stone fruit, as I would've expected - faint apple. The first night it smelled like an entry level Bordeaux Sauv Blanc (some melon waved hello) - but on day two, the scent was much more what I'm used to from the region. Strong citrus. 

On the palate, quite light - medium dry, so there is a tasty bit of sweetness. Not as much acidity as I would've hoped, a little restrained in that regard for my tastes. Also, at 12.5%, zero noticeable burn to speak of. In composition, a super easy drinker! Flavors of apples, lemon, lime - none of the nutty flavors I've grown to love in higher end examples of the appellation - very citrus dominant, like the nose. It's still in the mid 80s here in Florida, so a great white wine to enjoy chilled outside.

At the price point, I still favor Maison Darragon or Famille Bougrier, but it's still a good example of entry level Vouvray - refreshing and tasty. Recommended!

1gj5mdu,wine,"Kirkland 2023 Russian River Valley Pinot Noir Being relatively new to Costco, the idea of a serviceable weekday pinot noir (from the RRV AVA no less) for only $12 seemed intriguing.

Itâ€™s not as good as I hoped it would be, however, it managed to beat out the Belle Glos I reviewed a few days ago. Anywayâ€¦.

A little sweet for a pinot, and slightly heavier in mouthfeel than average, but for $12 itâ€™s not unbearably so. Itâ€™s just enough to remind you that youâ€™re drinking a mass produced pinot where some corners have been cut, and some liberties taken.

This is all red fruit, with cherry, raspberry, and strawberry. No dark fruit here to really speak of. Immediately following is the earthy notes of oak, smoke, and leather. Normally tasting notes of smoke and leather in wine is something that I absolutely love, but the residual sugar, vanilla, and heavier mouthfeel cloud over it all. Medium to medium-high acidity, although the slightly heavier mouthfeel impacts the versatility. 

Not bad, but also not something Iâ€™d buy as a weekday staple. This is a wine you bring to a party as an afterthought. I would drink this if served it, but this will remain a house party ice bucket bottle. 

My current weekday pinot staple remains Pacific Redwoodâ€™s Organic Pinot. At only $17 per bottle, Iâ€™ll gladly pay that small premium to get a much better product, even if it is usually a bitch to find.

A liquor store has the wine in the title (2021), which is normally â‚¬42, but is now on discount to â‚¬31.50. It's still a bit of a high price for what I usually want to spend, but I'm willing to spend it on something I think I'll enjoy (e.g. last week I picked up a 2007 Colheita port from Dow's for a similar price that I'm thoroughly enjoying).

I'll explain my tastes so that you have more information to recommend buying/not buying a bottle. I tend to far prefer fortified wine, port especially, but I'm currently in the process of learning more about wine since I want to explore the wine world. I tend to prefer white wine over red. I (somewhat) like chardonnay, but am not a big fan of sauvignon blanc. In terms of red, the ones I like the most are pinotage and shiraz, but don't really like cabernet sauvignon. I also like procescco.

I received a hearty recommendation for Chapoutier from someone I know that very much enjoys wine, and tried a bit of pinot noir from Chapoutier, which was pretty good. That's why I'm considering this bottle. I also bought a bottle of CÃ´tes du Rhone and CÃ´tes du Rhone Blanc from Chapoutier, but those two won't be opened for now (since there are several open bottles that need to be finished first), meaning I don't have a base point of comparison.

Would you guys recommend buying the bottle?

These are becoming my two go-to Barolos for highest QPR. The Vajra I feel is pretty commonly suggested to punch higher than the price. The Vietti is a staple producer and is hard to go wrong. For between $35-$45 itâ€™s hard to beat this. 

Do you have any suggestions that you feel are better for high QPR in this region?

Notes: I had these both earlier today so I have to  off memory so my post doesnâ€™t get removed. 

Vajra: classic brick Barolo color, bright red cherry, rose, tar, slight licorice. Medium high tannin, medium high acidity. Lots of fresh red fruit, well balanced. 92.

Vietti: Slightly more ruby than brick. Also lots of bright red fruit, tar, almost a meaty scent as well to it. Extremely smooth tannins balanced with a bright acidity. Well balanced and potential to cellar. 93.

1gio8jz,wine,"Opinions please: Opened a bottle of Chinon 2016 last night that we'd had on holiday last year and it was off - not distinctly corked, but off. It had been stored on it's side in our rack. What was weird about it was the bottle was coated in some kind of residue, but it didn't look like sediment. It was a very odd taste, not one I've had before from a wine. Like a nutmegy sort of quality. It's a bit hard to describe as I didn't taste it long, as it really wasn't pleasant. I would be the type to put up with a bad wine, but not with this one. 

We let it decant and breath in the hope it would come back, but it didn't. We had the wine last summer when we visited the vineyard, and it was really nice there, but something had obviously happened in the meantime. I've not seen this in a bottle before, but it was coated in some kind of dark film up to the cork, and it lingered there after the wine was poured and the bottle upright, as if the bottle had been stained.

Not the beautiful ruby color seen from Brittan and others. Strike one. That color often means a musty, wet hay-like nose. Delivered on that front. Unpleasant. Strike 2. And then the wine itself was thin and lacked brightness or structure. Strike 3.

All bursting from the glass. Palate is also a mouthful of ripe red fruits with whispers of earth, flowers and spice. Finish is not incredibly long but sufficient to warrant this 1er cru's reputation. After about an hour in the glass, tertiary notes begin to take over and the age shows. The fruit doesn't disappear but it steps into the background for all the earthy funky floral notes to pop out. Onto the Sancerre Rouge. Obviously more a contrast than comparison but wow what a difference! Smoky, dark and brooding. My fiancÃ©, who's notes I love, said it smells like a pirate. Big, big nose wafting out of the glass. Blackberries and cassis, aforementioned smoke, baking spices. Almost smells more Rhone than Loire. Same on the palate. Full bodied, silky tannins, well balanced overall. Ripe fruit, complex secondary notes, long finish. Cheaper than the Burgundy, too. (I suppose that's a given these days.)

1ghvs5y,wine,"Napa Sauv. blanc - help me understand (and possibly help my marriage) Hello!

My wife and I made a trip through Napa valley this summer (first time!) and went to St. Supery based on a recommendation from a friend.  They are well known for their sauvignon blancs, which are spectacular.  We liked their wines so much we joined their club even though we're on the east coast.  We have not EVER joined a club before, so that's how much we liked their stuff.

Fast forward a bit, and we have received a few shipments.  One of these wines - specifically [this one](https://www.stsupery.com/product/2023-rutherford-estate-vineyard-sauvignon-blanc/) \- is causing a disagreement between us.  While the taste is still wonderful, the wine has a strong, pungent, wet wool, dirty sock smell.  It his me in the face...this is not a subtle note.  But, my wife doesn't smell it at all, and thinks I'm nuts.  Usually she's the one that's able to identify flavors and notes more than me, so this is surprising.  This has happened with two different bottles form two different shipments, so I don't think it's related to an anomaly in storage, cork, etc.

I have a few questions for the experts here:

1 - Is this smell unique to the one drinking?  Is this sort of a cilantro/soap situation where I can smell the odor, but my wife is unable?

2 - what can cause this odor?  I've read a few articles that cite the reason as either lightstrike due to improper storage, chemical contamination, or bad yeast.  But, this is above my paygrade to answer.  I can say that we store all the bottles in a medium size, temp controlled wine fridge in our basement.

3 - is this an intended characteristic of the wine?  We've tried a few of the St. Supery Sauvignon Blancs and the Rutherford Estate is the only one that seems to carry this particular nose.

Would love to hear thoughts from you all!

Right now, Iâ€™m drinking Firestone Vineyard Merlot and my mouth immediately got itchy. I looked up the ingredients, and sure enough â€” hint of raspberries. After all the research Iâ€™ve done, Iâ€™m still confusedâ€¦

1ghf6wl,wine,"Open Your Wine Autumn - September and October roundup Some of you may have read my previous post on this topic, but for those of you just tuning in, Open Your Wine Autumn is a new tradition I have inaugurated which is exactly what it sounds like: A season-long excuse to open any wine that needs an excuse for opening, a yearly cure to the plague of ""waiting for a special occasion"" to crack that nice bottle you're sitting on for no compelling reason. As autumn calls to mind the natural cycles of aging and death, the wise wino, never taking life, health, or time for granted, knows to drink up while they still have the chance. Or, to put things in a slightly more grounded way: I get really bored of only ever opening 'responsible' weeknight bottles ad infinitum when I know I've got more exciting stuff sitting in my fridge, and I want to go a little apeshit for going apeshit's sake from time to time.

To that end I have put my modest amount of money where my mouth is and opened a few of the nicer bottles in my collection since September. I've done this on random weeknights, I've had them with burgers and shawarma and Popeye's and Chinese take-out, and I've consumed every one of them on my living room couch, mostly in pajamas. Since I've got until December 21st to keep #OYWA up I've not yet escalated to the bottles I've been most precious about (stay tuned for the December roundup for those), but I have dusted off the far reaches of my wine fridge and cleared out a good number of lovely bottles which had been waiting patiently for anywhere from 1-3 years for me to get around to drinking them.

In no particular order, here is the most recent batch of the wines I have opened so far this autumn in the spirit of OYWA:

\---

Alessandra Divella Dosaggio Zero Rose de Saignee NV - This stuff was incredible, I love good Franciacorta and having really enjoyed Divella's 'NiNi' at the Four Horsemen a year or two ago I was very excited to find another of her zero-dosage wines at a local shop. I didn't take very detailed notes on this ('strawberry' and 'yeast', ok, very helpful, past me) but with a bit of air on it it went from deceptively simple to absolutely screaming with flavor and aroma that'd make any grand cru grower champagne jealous. Not sure what the hell I meant by ""almost carnal"" but that's in my notes too? Fascinating color, a kind of rusty pinkish sultana raisin hue. World class Franciacorta, will be an insta-buy if I ever come across it again. This stuff begs to be paired with a meal; I think I had mine with fried chicken?

Catherine & Pierre Breton 'Les Perrieres' Bourguiel 2015 - This was a slightly shy Cab Franc that really wanted some time in a decanter to start expressing itself, but an absolute pleasure to drink once it did. Serious depth of flavor with your typical herby-peppery raspberry and earth accord, structured but easy drinking (""digestible"" if you like) at the same time. Had it with a burger and mac salad and could not have asked for a better pairing.

Chateau Simone Palette Rouge 2009 - Had been seeing this gathering dust for ages at a local shop and I'm glad I rescued it. One of those interesting southern French blends, mostly Grenache and Mourvedre with a whole hodgepodge of supporting grapes. Reminded me a bit of a Bordeaux at first with its strong red fruit-mineral-leather thing it had going on, but with sufficient air and warmth it started showing really interesting eucalyptus and licorice and garrigue notes. Really beautiful at 15 years and seemed like it would only get better with more age.

Olivier Horiot ""En Valingrain"" Rose des Riceys 2018 - I had the En Barmont a little earlier this year and loved it, and I liked this one even better. Fascinatingly 'textural' Pinot Noir, it has this kind of mercurial combination of density and lightness I find very hard to put into words; at the risk of getting too silly here it has a certain mysterious, magical energy and otherworldly tension to it. In any case I could drink a pail of the stuff; very tasty strawberry and sour cherry notes, herbaceous, a touch of cedar or pencil shavings. Really cool dark ruby color too, the kind of wine you want to look at with a flashlight. If those red health potions you drink in video games were real, this is what drinking one would feel like.

Domaine de l'Enclos Chablis GC 'Vaudesir' 2020 - One of my favorite white wines I've had all year, the kind of Chardonnay that just puts a smile on my face. I was enjoying myself too much to take detailed notes (I recall lemon, mineral, and smoke) but I did note that it was both serious and deep enough I wanted to take my time with it and also delicious and refreshing enough I wanted to neck a liter of it and ask for seconds.

Domaine de la Chevalerie Grand-Mont Bourguiel 2015 - I enjoyed this, although after having sat on it for nearly 3 years I was left wondering why I waited so long as it didn't really feel all that momentous. (That's the benefit of OYWA, I guess.) Interesting lychee black tea and barnyard notes which I find typical of this kind of low-intervention Loire Cab Franc, a bit of spice, raspberry, leather, plum, a bit of earth. Deep purplish-garnet color. If you've had Chevalerie's other offerings you can imagine a somewhat more structured, ageworthy version of those and you'll know exactly what you're in for with this.",0.042,0.768,0.191,0.9995,not_negative,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

1ggsgoa,wine,"Review: Belle Glos Clark & Telephone Pinot Noir Soâ€¦this says pinot noir on the bottle, but this does *not* taste like pinot noir. This tastes over-extracted and is syrupy in body/mouthfeel. Dark purple in color, much darker than a pinot noir should be. Needless to say, I can immediately tell this is heavily manipulated like Prisoner and Caymus.

Heavy notes of sweet vanilla, and oak thatâ€™s of an unnatural character. The fruit is a non-distinct mix of mostly dark and some red. I can make out lots of blackberry,  and some cherry and smoke.

This is neither elegant or structured. I would honestly look elsewhere for a quality pinot. It doesnâ€™t even taste that good generally.

Lionel Osmin & Cie

Med golden colour

Nose: lots of lees-y, almost champagne-like brioche notes, citrus, and vanilla

Palate: very concentrated, expressive citrus notes (orange peel, lemon), well integrated oak (vanilla, lees characteristics), minerals, very long finish

Beautiful freshness really helps balance out the high alcohol (15%) and oak notes, gives it energy and acidic grip that melts into a long, waxy finish. Not usually a fan of big oaky whites, but that was very moreish. 

Got it on clearance and sad I didnâ€™t get everything they had.

1gh7yi1,wine,"Your favorite Aglianicos So I recently got back from a trip to Italy, we were lucky enough to visit Rome and Naples and I made it a point to try some local wines. In my first couple days in Campania I had tried a Taurasi Reserva and another Aglianico and noticed both had a sort of bitter taste or bitter finish that I wasn't enjoying. On a trip out to Amalfi Coast we stopped at Ettori Sammarco, a small winery right on the coast in Ravello. Which I highly recommend stopping in if you're in the area. Very family feel, they have a little tasting counter in the winery and the founder/owner was right there overseeing the work and chatting with us. I believe he is 92 and still involved!I tried some delicious whites and some of their reds and fell in love with their reserve that is 70% Aglianico, 30% Pie de Rosso. It had none of the bitterness and everything I loved about the other wines I had tried. Talking with the host and the owner they mentioned there are multiple types of Aglianicos and the terroir of Ravello is part of why their wines don't have the same bitterness as others. 


I brought some bottles back that I'll sit on for a bit but I'm looking for other recommendations of Aglianicos that don't have that bitter note. As much as I'd love to order direct from Sammarco, ordering by the case with international shipping isn't in my budget at the moment (maybe as a treat down the road). I also get the feeling the other Aglianicos I tried may have been too young and those bitter notes may mellow out of the years. So I'm not opposed to grabbing some bottles to set aside.

There is currently allot of websites quoting this one guy who did a research project that says wine does not need to be stored horizontally.

The problem is his study only lasted 5 years and in many of the articles he references the AWRI (but the AWRI says wine should be stored horizontally)

  
[https://www.awri.com.au/industry\_support/winemaking\_resources/storage-and-packaging/post-packaging/transport-and-storage/](https://www.awri.com.au/industry_support/winemaking_resources/storage-and-packaging/post-packaging/transport-and-storage/)

He claims that after a 5 year research project that corks will last almost indefinitely in the upright position.

Obviously that does not make sense as real life wine collectors know all to well the issues with dried up corks.

Does anybody know of any other research proving him right or wrong?

I donâ€™t think traditional tasting notes work for these wines, Iâ€™d have to tell you about the wildly high volatile acidity on the red and the almost too much texture on the white and we would fixate on that and never get to the important part. 

These are emotional wines, thereâ€™s not many producers that can make you feel as much in a wine as Kenjiro does, that doesnâ€™t mean the wines are easy by any means, I think most people would be surprised and probably not understand if they saw just how much VA is in the wines but then you taste them and the only reaction is to smile.

I just turned 21 the other day and to mark my ability to legally purchase a bottle of wine I plan on buying a nice bottle of Bordeaux. I have done a ton of research over the past few months about wine, especially Bordeaux. I'm also pretty familiar with wine because my dad is in the wine business. If I'm being honest though, I'm just starting to appreciate wine, and I don't quite know yet what my personal preferences are. With that being said I want to buy a bottle of Bordeaux to start my cellar with. I narrowed my search down to 2 wines 2020 Figeac or 2020 Chateau Ducru-Beaucaillou. If I am going with rankings, WA gave the Figeac 100 points (My dad says WA is the best ranking followed by WS). On the other hand, I think the Ducru Beaucaillou is a little more elegant which I think is more my style(I just don't know yet for sure though). Another major criteria I have is which wine will be ready first. I would like to drink these wines within the decade. Does anyone have any thoughts? I do plan on buying a few other cheaper wines to get started but I wanted a nice bottle to store. Sorry for the long post I just don't know what direction I should go.

Back in 2001/2002, my husband and I stopped in, tried some of their wines, and bought a few. One that we really enjoyed was their late harvest Symphony dessert wine (vintage 2000), despite not being dessert wine people at all. We drank one bottle later in our vacation in San Francisco, and brought some others home to the east coast. 

All these years later, we still had one bottle of that Late Harvest Symphony hanging around. After so many years, we assumed it had gone bad, but didnâ€™t want to toss it out, but also never had the desire to open it. 

Until tonight. 

Neighbors came over to celebrate my husbandâ€™s birthday, brought dessert, and I suggested this as the night we open the very old wine. And it wasâ€¦.

Not as bad as we expected! Not as good as we remembered, but it was drinkable. 

Still had faint traces of the apricot, peach, and pear we remembered. Lost the florals. Had some port-like notes. Not terrible for a 24-year old wine! Hats off to the winemaker. ðŸŽ©

Nose: fresh berries, luxardo cherry, licorice, baking spice, cola, brine. 

Mouth: liquid silk. Medium bodied, tannins have completely integrated. Absolutely no harsh edges here. Bright cherry, dried herbs, lavender, tobacco, country ham. Long finish, good acidity. Finished the first glass far faster than Iâ€™m proud to admit: this is a wine that wants to be drunk.

1) what damage is being done to the wine at that temperature? Itâ€™s been there three months. It is a mix of Pinot Noir and Cab Sauv
2) what is the most economical and safe way to get the wine to Texas?

The whole collection might be worth $5,000-7,000 - I am not really interested in high-end wine shipping, but I donâ€™t want to fly up to Colorado and rent a car to bring it down to Texas. I am considering securely packing it up and checking it on a United flight across 3-4 boxes. I am confident that a â€œfragileâ€ sticker and proper packing would ensure its safety on the plane to about 99%.

I got a gift after attending a wedding this bottle of wine in Georgia.

I am seriously very bad when it comes to Wine or alcohol in general. And I know this post might offend some people haha.

1gdsbqq,wine,"Rocks district Syrah recommendations  I recently had a couple bottles of Syrah from walla walla. The first was the base walla walla Syrah from Gramercy Cellars and the other was The Unnamed Series 2019 Syrah. I found both of these wines to be absolutely mind blowing. I am relatively new to wine and havenâ€™t developed great vocabulary for what I am tasting, but I loved how â€˜crispâ€™ the Gramercy Cellars was but still had a depth of darker fruit almost savory taste was. The Unnamed Series was great because it felt like over the course of the evening like I was drinking 3 separate wines. When I first opened it it had the same crispness I liked in the Gramercy bottle, but then changed to an almost smoky flavor. After about another hour the smoke gave way to a really delicious funky fruity wine. Really great stuff. 

All of this has made me extremely curious about other Walla Walla producers. My first question is: in my researching these bottles I have noticed people say rocks Syrah has a distinct funk. I am assuming thatâ€™s what I liked in the second bottle. Do other grapes besides Syrah exhibit this funky flavor from Rocks producers? My second question is i am looking for recommendations for wines similar to the ones i described. When I was trying to dig up different producers I ran across Cayuse and Reynvaan, both seem hard to find and expensive.

1gduusy,wine,"How do I get into learning about red wine? Hello wine community.
Over the last year or so, Iâ€™ve really gotten into liking wines, reading about them and tasting them - but only whites. Mainly because I prefer whites, but also because I have an easier time distinguishing notes and differentiating the wines. I especially find Rieslings interesting, as the wines are incredibly versatile (I love crisp Riesling from Mosel, especially ones only harvested and made 1-2 years ago). NZ Sauvignons are also a favorite of mine (I prefer crisp, acidic, fruity and dry whites.) 

But reds just seem so much more difficult and hard to grasp? Where do I start? What grapes/areas? Also the notes and palates - for some reason I just do not find it as easy as smelling/tasting them on whites. How do I get going? 

I do drink reds - and like them - but the knowledge is very basic (I know I like Pinots).

Â 

I come from an environment where drinking is considered normal. This goes for not just my family, but basically everyone I grew up with. Parents of friends down the street, social gatherings like birthdays, diner parties. Ever since I was a kid, almost all the adults in my life drank alcohol. A considerable portion of the friends I have now, also like to drink. Not all are heavy drinkers, but if I am being honest it feels like I am verging on the edge of alcoholism myself and I know for a fact both my parents are and have been alcoholics for a long time.

Â 

What â€˜kept me in the darkâ€™ for a long time is that no-one around me really seemed to be compromised in their daily lives because of this life-style. Functioning addicts (not all of them, but still), so to speak. If I am being honest (again) I also donâ€™t see the problem in drinking whatever amount if itâ€™s someoneâ€™s choice and it doesnâ€™t come with harmful consequences for that person or his/her surroundings.

Â 

However, someone really close to me has developed a condition which really has damaged the way I view this person, and at time makes me want to cut him/her out of my life for good. Thus, the reason of this post.

Â 

Is it possible for some-one who has been drinking all his/her life to develop a sort of allergy of alcohol?

Â 

The person I am referring to may be having a pleasant conversation with you, but as soon as the first glass of wine is consumed things take a turn. The visual aspects of someone who is completely drunk are recognizable immediately (which is â€˜too soonâ€™) but even worse, the personâ€™s whole character seems to change. The same anecdotes are told back to back. Mean verbal jabs are made. His or her opinion on things are really extreme, but seem to be completely random, like the real â€˜he or sheâ€™ is completely gone.

Â 

It's just like the tolerance is completely gone, and a sort of super random auto-pilot takes over. I know it sounds like I am describing someone who is black-out drunk but like I said, this occurs after just one glass of wine, and this person has been drinking all his/her life.

Triolet 2020 - Less salinity and complexity, this was a challenging vintage. Similar lemon and lime but also a little grassy yet a little brighter than the 2015. Citrus galore on the palate, however feels thinner and less complex. 

Triolet 2022 - The standout for the Triolet here, this one is so well integrated. Has complexity beyond the 2015 and also tastes older than the 2015. Zippy yet creamy and well balanced. 2022 is a great vintage.

Chardonnay 2020 - Buttery and rich on the nose, refreshing salinity and yellow fruits. Still great complexity for this challenging year. 

Chardonnay 2021 - Like the 2020 but more fresh, more acidity and more fruit forward. A buffed up version of the 2020.

Chardonnay 2022 - Okay so what a vintage for the whites this is, so complex and drinking well beyond its years. This is a standout and so well integrated already, this would be exciting to revisit in 10 years. 

Marli Russell 2021 - A new endeavour by Mount Mary focusing on Rhone varieties grown and vinified at the estate. Big red fruit nose, core of strawberry and jam, smells like a farmers market. The palate is light and fresh with strawberry, cranberry, light as a feather, wow! Young Grenache vines so itâ€™s less concentrated fruit and lacks the earthiness you expect from a GSM. 

Marli Russell 2022 - This one has darker fruits, jammy plum and boysenberry, very brooding on the nose. Palate similar to the 2021 but more concentrated fruits. 

Pinot Noir 2021 - Very excited, my favourite Australian Pinot, feels like its weightless on the nose, dark red fruit core, porcelain on the palate itâ€™s so delicate, floats effortlessly with a trio of strawberry, slight pepper and vanilla pods.

Quintet 2014 - Deep and concentrated, blackcurrant and boysenberry with dried vanilla pods. Dark and ripe red fruits converging on a medium body. 10 years on and could still go a long way! 

Quintet 2017 - More liquorice and pronounced red fruits compared to the 2014, I get a little eucalyptus too. This one could almost fool me as Margaret River in a blind tasting.

It doesn't have to make money. I doubt the world needs more amateur wine writers. Ideas I've had... I could go in as an investor if a friend with industry experience starts a wine bar. Non profit? I have lots of contacts in the Middle East and could do something somehow helping winemakers in marginal areas?? Doing boutique imports is probably the easiest to initiate from a mechanical point of view but sounds capital-intensive, low and possibly negative margin and generally a pain in the ass unless I actually tried to scale it up. Would involve tax-deductible travel and probably good home drinking in direct proportion to sales failure but I'm under no illusions as to the glamour (my father shipped industrial material around the world and it seemed very painful).

Any ideas?

1gckn96,wine,"First time trying old wine (Lafite 1988) Tried 3 different vintages of Lafite during the Decanter Masterclass in Singapore. 

2018 was very tight and tannic with primary fruits dominating both the aroma and palette. Can see how the wine will be elegant and great in the future. 

2008 was more advanced but still had great structure and started to show more softness but still had the primary fruit core. 

1988 was the one that made me go â€˜what the hell!?!?â€™ The first sniff I took almost made me gag. The barnyard funk was so strong that I thought I put my head into a pail of horse shit. Honestly, Iâ€™m not sure if this is representative of what older Bordeaux wines taste like. But it was quite revolting. The speaker remarked that we have to look past the barnyard funk to see the underlying tertiary notes. At this point, I was seriously questioning if the wine was corked or spoilt but it was my first time trying a 30+ yo wine and everyone around me didnâ€™t say anything so I didnâ€™t want to raise any questions lol. 

For those of you whoâ€™ve tried this vintage in recent years or have had experience with much older Bordeaux reds, is it common to have such a strong barnyard funk (smelling like horse shit)?

Wachter-Wiesler are a well established producer from there, making BlaufrÃ¤nkisch in a terroir-driven style that focuses on refinement and freshness. The wine hails from the Weinberg vineyard in the village of Deutsch-SchÃ¼tzen. It has a souther exposition and its soil consists of iron rich clay. After spontaneous fermentation and spent 34 months in a large oak casks.

I aerated the wine for about 1 1/2 hours after opening and served it in a Spiegelau Definition Bordeaux glass. It has an opaque ruby colour and garnet rim.

On the nose the wine presents itself with dark fruity aromas at first, think of luxardo cherry, sloe and plum. Soon after, more savoury notes take control, hallmark notes of Eisenberg BlaufrÃ¤nkisch like blood and iodine come through immediately. The wine then also presents notes of crushed stones, undergrowth and black pepper. Furthermore, a well integrated hint of barnyard funk, citrus and earth envelope the wine.

The palate shows intense fruit of sloe and dark cherry at first, minerality and earthy notes come through as well. A very fresh acidity and structured, but not overpowering tannins add structure. A long finish brings the wine to an end, showing notes of luxardo cherry, meat juices, leather and herbal tones.

Another Eisenberg-banger after the Weninger Saybritz for me! It shows a perfect interplay of fruity, savoury and lightly spicy notes at this point of development.

1gcbvpu,wine,"Ideal Wine Cellar Inventory According to Little's Law Little's law is a quick way to determine the optimal number of widgets in a process, whether it is a part in a manufacturing process, or a bottle in a wine cellar. 

The law says that the number of inventory items during steady state is equal to the average processing time (holding period) multiplied by the consumption rate.

Steady Inventory = Holding Period X Consumption Rate

For example. If I consume 52 bottles of wine per year, and I want to cellar each bottle for an average of 5 years, my ideal cellar inventory is 52x5=260.

More than 260 bottles means I won't consume enough before they age out, less than 260 means I'm consuming more than what my target holding period will allow. 

It's a simple way to perform a gut check for the ""how much is too much?"" question regarding how much wine to buy and cellar.

Story: in the early 1990s we planted a beautiful rolling 68 acres site to Chardonnay here in Carneros in the cool southernmost part of Napa Valley it established our vineyard using sustainable farming practices. in 1994 we harvested our first fruit. this vintage celebrates 25 years of wine produced from the Chardonnay grown in our spectacular sight.

Here are my notes, with an albeit stuffy nose :(

Pastourelle de Clerc Milon 2020

meaty, austere, drinking well for its age. slight herbaciousness
88 points

Ch Clerc Milon 2018
More fruit than 2nd label, soft tannins, has 2% Carmenere which is very interesting .
94-95 points

NOTE: after tasting through everything in this wild lineup, the value/QPR of Clerc Milon really stood out to me!! I wish I took more detailed notes on this.

Ch d Armailhac 2015
soft nose, but not extremely expressive. fruit was there but a bit one dimensional. long lasting finish. 93 pts

Petit Mouton 2010
dark color, but the garnet is starting to appear on the edges
nose not as pronounced but came out a bit - likely just needed to open up
palate was fantastic. black cherry, dark fruit, slight graphite, vanilla,  tannis were present and a bit grippy. meaty and vanilla finish. this wine is about to enter its prime, if it isnâ€™t already. finish was long and enjoyable. 
95-96 pts


Mouton Rothschild 2009
color: still dark but the tawny look around the edges
nose: pronounced, black currant, dark and lightly stewed fruits
mouth: extremely silky, balanced, slightly warm, pronounced cherry, fresh vanilla, looong finish - creme brulee, vanilla, cherry. lasted 10 minutes if not longer

the finish specifically developed in my mouth - i wish we decanted!
97 pts - but i think if this was decanted it would reach 98

Mouton Rothschild 2005
dark and tawny color
nose: stewed fruit, some vanilla, toasted nuts
palate: fresh fruit on the edge of the palate that morphs into a somewhat stewed fruit on the center of the palate. still a good structure - this wine is in its early prime (for my palate) tannins are present and silky, but  leaves a grip that wants me wanting so much more.

97 pts - also probably needed a decant


Personally, â€˜09>â€™05, but they were both excellent.


Chateau Coutet Sauternes-Barsac 2008
nose: pear, citrus, ginger which allows the flavor to pierce through the nose
palate: the candied ginger is so awesome on this. it has all your classic sauternes notes, but the way the ginger makes this so unique has me really happy with this.

I was really happy to learn recently that K&L had a shipping affiliate that shipped to other states than CA. They're called RareStorage and the shipping rates seemed really reasonable. I filled up a couple cases of wine, paid for shipping and insurance and since then it has been a nightmare. 

They shipped my wine through GLS, who proceeded to drop my wine off in a different state than the one I live in. Now, nobody seems to know where it is, or when it will get to my house. K&L can't really help, although they have tried and their customer service is excellent, but RareStorage is a separate company. RareStorage won't talk to you on the phone and so you rely on email correspondence. They provided me with a new tracking number yesterday that was incorrect which further complicated things. I contacted GLS, who has assured me twice now that their operations team will contact me. That hasn't happened.

To K&Ls credit, they have really tried to help, but it seems their hands are tied. It also sounds like RareStorage uses different shipping companies for different states, so you could get lucky and have your wines shipped via UPS or Fed-Ex depending on your location. If you're considering having wines shipped through RareStorage, I would first inquire about which shipping company they'll use to get the wines to you. Also - for my state, there was not an overnight or 2 day shipping option. That probably should have raised red flags in itself, but by the time I realized that, it was too late. 

I know plenty of people here have had good experiences with K&L, and this really isn't their fault. But I did want to give the community a heads up that their affiliate is less commendable and your mileage may vary, depending on where you live.

New to wine in general, brought back two bottles of champagne from a recent trip I was hoping to store for five years.

I was reading that normal fridges get too dry which is bad for the cork and keeping the storage trouble free.

100% Chardonnay

Medium yellow to light golden in color. 

On the nose: candied pineapple, mango, rice cakes, peach, saltine crackers, white flowers, balsa wood and dry stone. 

Medium to medium plus body, rich, unctuous, close to if not bone dry, medium acid but still pleasingly crisp, with notes of unsalted popcorn, yellow apple, Asian pear, fresh unripe pineapple, clementine skin, and chalk. Very slight tannic grip from oak aging, and overall the oak here is forward but well integrated. Intensely long finish with green apple and white nectarine, toasty oak. After about 2 hours of air, additional secondary notes of toasted almonds and cinnamon come through towards the finish. 

A gorgeous bottle of white wine and very solid example of the Chassagne-Montrachet style.

I'm looking for tips, tricks and/or tactics for remembering wine details. 

I have just started as a somm and am finding that it is difficult to get all the details locked down for the wines. I am expected to remember the winemaking and tasting notes for all of the BTG and Pairing wines but I keep getting things mixed up or just can't seem to lock it into memory.

 For example, Elk Cove Pinot Noir comes from 6 sites that are fermented separately in stainless steel and blended then matured in French oak for 10 months, using Pommard and Dijon clones. Then I'll have Hartford Court Chardonnay from Russian River Valley in Sanoma that is barrel fermented with 28% new French oak and aged for 9.5 months with weekly lees string and goes through full malolactic conversion. 

  
Two very different wines, made in very different ways but when I have to remember those details for 20, 30, 40 plus wines I find that I get aging times mixed up or the blend mixed up and so on, especially if the wines are similar. 

  
Wondering if anyone out there has ideas for how to get these things memorized. Event if its seems simple, I am just trying to pool different ideas I could adopt.

Casanova di Neri & Tenuta Il Poggione were decanted for 2.5 hours before drinking and the Le ragnaie was poured out in the glass and we started drinking it after 45 mins .

to me the winner among these wines tonight is definitely the casanova di neri , come close at second place , le ragnaie 2019 which did not opened up as I hope during the night 

on the nose the 2018 casanova di neri is simply beautiful ,notes : plum , cherry , oaky , chocolate , tobacco , spice  , tannins are very well integrated .

ended the night with a bottle of Tokaji i brought back from my trip to Budapest , sold by Faust Wine Cellar . I have not tasted alot of tokaji or dessert wine , but this bottle is absolutely delightful to be paired with the pandan swissroll . perfect ending to the night

1gateoa,wine,"My Mt. Etna experience and the regionâ€™s parallels with Burgundy I just got back from Sicily for my honeymoon, and as part of the trip that I got to plan we visited two wineries: Benanti and Girolamo Russo. Both had fantastic wines with great tour guides/somms that took you through a flight of 5 or 6 of their wines. What made the latter visit extra special however was getting to experience some of the harvest of their Nerello Mascalese grapes. 
As you might know, things go a little differently in Europe and you canâ€™t just stop by unannounced at the tasting room, you need to email them and reserve a time slot for a good 2-3 hr or longer experience likely to be paired with multiple courses and/or walks through the vineyard. 
Benantiâ€™s wines and historic production house turned modern showcase are impressive, with a large old wooden press and art adorning the rooms that had a sort of royal, medieval vibe to them, only surrounded by lava rocks. We tasted a beautiful sparkling metodo classico brut Rosato (that they no longer make or at least sell and distribute past 2020), a contrada bianco, a 10 yr old Nerello Cappuccio, and 2 more reds including a 2011 Serra Della Contessa, probably their most prized vineyard boasting centenarian vines behind the property on the side of a SE facing hill. This was all paired with thoughtfully paired food courses for each person. We didnt have the Pietra Marina, but I left with two 2019s after reading and hearing first hand how ageworthy it is.
Girolamo Russo is a newer winery with their own unique story that I wonâ€™t get into here, but the tour was incredibly special. The woman leading our experience let us work the sortable table before taking us through each of their main vineyards by having us follow in our rental car within the different contrade, or sub zones. We eventually walked up to their current tasting room if you can call it that, for their entire lineup including a metodo classico and pet-nat I didnâ€™t know they made. All these wines were just as impressive, each having their own character depending on the contrada they represented. 

After touring the vineyards I remember being struck by all parallels to Burgundy: the lava rock walls surrounding all the vineyards, much like a clos; thereâ€™s many different producers working in the same contrada, and Mt Etnaâ€™s wines are extremely elegant and mineral, with red and white expressions made from mostly single varietal grapes (especially the higher end bottles). I even remember thinking I could totally mistake Girolamo Russoâ€™s San Lorenzo Bianco for a high quality 1er cru Chablis. When I mentioned some of this to our somm she replied, â€œyou know they call it the Burgundy of the South!â€ She wasnâ€™t kiddingâ€”after looking back at the World Atlas of Wine, Jancis Robertson says â€œSome see it as the new CÃ´te dâ€™Or, and vine holdings are similarly parcellated.â€ 
Thereâ€™s a lot incredible wine there, with many relatively newer wineries tending some diverse and exciting terroir. And if you love bubbles, especially rose, thereâ€™s amazing QPR to be had there too!

An enticing pale ruby colour. The nose is very aromatic with fruit cake, dried figs, cherry, and olive brine supported by an earthiness with some mushroom and lager.  

A light body with some light acidity right out the bottle complimented by very fine chalky tannins which dissipate over the second pour. Immediately getting sour cherries with strawberries and red currants. The secondary earthiness is also present with that great mushroom and cured meat which gives it that classic French savoury feel.

Poggio di Sotto Brunello di Montalcino 2017

Decanted and drank over two hours. 

My first experience with this legendary Brunello producer and it did not disappoint.

2017 has an unfair rep as a ""bad"" vintage, but I think 2017 Brunello from good producer is still good Brunello and, very importantly, pretty ready to drink now. This isn't for aging over decades (save that for the 2016s and 2019s).

Initially pretty tannic, but with air, really opened up.

Notes of red cherry, red plum, chestnut, soil. Over time, the fruit notes came to the forefront.

Really lovely wine that could benefit from further aging, but is already approachable.

Explosion of red berries on the nose. Like a smoothy of raspberries that is deliciously inviting. Background notes of sagebrush and dessert shrubs but really the raspberries stole all my attention.

On the palate, you immediately think bright red fruits that give a full mouth feel but without making you exhausted with it being a typical CA red wine. It was bright and lovely and balance with a nice acidity. The finsih went on for days, like a treat.

Overall it's a classy example of Anderson Valley pinot noir. Really love to drink on its own but I snacked on some charcuterie and truffle cheese, which was perfect.

94/100. I regret I didn't pick up a second bottle.

I'm from Germany, specifically from the Riesling region, where wine is a big part of the culture. Funny enough, I noticed pretty early on that I can't really handle wine. Where Iâ€™m from, itâ€™s common to mix white wine with water to make a refreshing spritzer, so I didn't think much about it growing up since it was always diluted.

As I got older, I moved away from white wine and started trying red wines, but soon switched almost entirely to beer after spending some time in Bavaria. Now Iâ€™ve realized that whenever I have just one glass of wine, it gives me stomachaches and gastrointestinal issues that last through the next day. At first, I thought maybe it was an alcohol thing, but I can drink two liters of beer without any problems.

Has anyone else experienced this? Could there be something specific in wine that causes these issues? Or is it possible that beer, with its anti-inflammatory compounds, helps counteract the effects of alcohol on my stomach?

Any insights would be appreciated!

Information about these wines is hard to come by, much of what I could find was derived from semi-cryptic instagram posts from the winemaker himself, so if anyone knows more about these please chime in. Production is very small, usually well under 100 cases per wine, and each wine is a one-off that is made for a specific vintage and terroir. 

Over the the last couple months I have tried two bottles of Pequodâ€™s 2022 Wine for Extraterrestrials, a skinsy, reductive Chardonnay from Tumbarumba (production of approx. 70 cases), and one bottle of the 2021 ðŸ’ŽðŸ™Œ (diamond hands) Syrah, a cool-climate, RhÃ´ne-style Syrah from Murrumbateman (production of approx. 40 cases).

1g7gxud,wine,"Stefano Amerighi syrah 2021 I hear a lot of people saying this is the best syrah outside France, so i thought i could get some shit making a post about it.

Premises: 
-I'm not a syrah connoisseur so i'm not compairing this with other wines but i'll refer to basic stuff i know about this variety, so feel free to correct me.

-I decanted it because it felt extremely closed after i tasted it and i didn't have time to see how long would have taked to open leaving it by itself. (Explanation for the non americans that don't decant every liquid contained in a glass bottle /s)

Since i pass by cortona very often for work, i went to this lovely winery to grab a couple of bottles.
They finished E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G. They've got nothing till next April. They kindly redirected me to a nice local grocery shop that had some. Lucky me

The winery is byodinamic and they say in the back label they press the grapes with feets. (Yummy)

Sooo, great color, deep dark ruby with violet shades, nonetheless, it leaves light pass through its body even enancing the brightness, when put under a lamp.
Less viscous than i would expect.

While smelling the cork i've got a strong hint of licorice that wasn't so dominant after.
In the glass the wine wasn't particularly intense, i could't properly discern many of the aromas exeption made for obvious violets, maybe some red roses, blackberries, ripe plums, sour cherries under spirit and the weakened hint of licorice.

In the mouth it felt very unbalanced, a strong acidity covered most of the wine's body. Alcol, low viscosity and sweetness weren't balancing the hardness of the wine.

I decanted it for about an hour, during this hour i sampled it and i might have smelled something a bit off one time. No trace of that after pouring at the end of decantation.

Now the nose was good: hint of tobacco added to the width of the wine, some fruit switched a bit on the jammy side and the sour cherry lost the alcoholic tone that was a bit too penetrative on the first try.

Mouth got the best out of it. Obviousely the acidity lowered and left space to some of the best tannins i've ever felt: smooth, silky and well integrated, i almost wanted to have more of em.
At this point the alcol was doing his job, supporting the sharp oriented body of the wine, so the low viscosity could leave you drink this well bodied wine like an easy pinot noir. Majestic job from the winemaker.
Finish was long enough, not something out of the world

The empty glass left a lovely, proustian for me, blackberry jam scent.

Few sediments were left on the bottom of the decanter.

I paired it with polish veil steak, dry-aged for 35 days and my 2 days old olive oil.
I was scared the dry-aging might have made the meat a bit too hematic and intense for the wine but it worked like a charm. The body of the wine integrated with the strong meat flavor and the acidity cleaned the greasiness of the fat and the oil, leaving the soft tannins and the animal flavor for long on the tongue.

30â‚¬   great, great wine. 95-96 points (93-94 imho) only took away points for complexity, equilibrium and intensity.
I didn't consider the sediments since they weren't it the tasted glass and gave max points for visual look. Maximum points for quality on both nose and mouth even if i'm not conviced about that. I think suckling gave it 98pt (wtf)


Ok, but why i didn't like it enough?

-In the end the acidity lowered but was still a bit too much, you could taste the greatness of the wine but idk, you had to kinda look at it through a window(?).
It needs few more years on his back, i hope the rest of the body won't lose anything

-I read about people saying this wine has great complexity. That's not what i call ""great complexity"".
1 flower and a half, 3 dark fruits and licorice is not complex, is the average note of a rich newbie tasting Petrus.
What are you gonna call a wine with 10 well defined deacriptors and hints of tar, vinyl and leather?
Even konstantin baum sais it has some flowers, blackberries, plum and pepper (that i don't actually percieve here and he explains why that's pretty common) and then proceeds to sing the praises of the great complexity of this wine. Am i missing something or that's just as wrong as it seems to me?

-I admit it just isn't my genre of wine lol.

I've been a growing fan of aromatic white wines with Alsace being chief among my go-to regions. I recently returned from my second stay in the area last month and decided to seek out some interesting wines back here state-side. 

I've not had the opportunity to visit Domaines Barmes-Buecher in my travels to Alsace, but it is definitely on my short list for a potential third trip. This particular bottling comes from the hills to the south-west of Wettolsheim, which is just west of Colmar. I absolutely love the older style label, it reflects much of the character of the region, even of it is a little marketing unfriendly. 

Onto what ended up in the glass: PnP initially and let it develop in the open bottle over the course of the evening. Deep gold/amber color, floral, honey and dried peach aromas. Flavors of honeysuckle, candied walnuts, dried peach, apricot and lychee. Medium long finish with some herbal spice and lasting sweetness. 

I had some initial concern about the age of this bottle vis-a-vis it's lieu-dit status. While a Grand Cru Gewurz could easily go for this kind of age, (or Trimbach's Seigneurs de Ribeaupierre) I wasn't sure about this producer's style, the individual terroir, or how much RS was there to help this expression along. This ended up being a treat, and I'm further convinced of the underrated ability of Gewurztraminer to age, at least when it is of the opulent Alsace style.

1g6zskj,wine,"2001 Sassicaia and spicy Indian food, what a pairing!  Drank from a 375ml bottle. 

I'm a huge fan of half bottles, they let you enjoy a glass of nice wine without committing to an entire bottle. Perfect for a glass at home before going out for the night.

Stood up for a few hours before opening. Needed a Durand to open, there was some discoloration on top of the cork. Thankfully, cork didn't crumble and bottle was totally fine, no cork taint, no brett.

First sip was actually ready to drink right away, tannins weren't harsh at all. But decided to slow ox for an hour before drinking, then drank over the next hour.

Over time, developed notes of dark plum, blackberry, dark cherry, rosemary. On the palate, medium acidity and nice long finish. Tannins definitely mellowed out with age. 

Shockingly, this paired very well with spicy pongal (a South Indian rice and lentil based dish). Another reminder that Indian food can pair really well with the right red wine, even though restaurants continue to insist on sparkling and semi-dry whites as the right pairing.

Iâ€™m planning a 3-day trip to Healdsburg, CA, and would love your recommendations for wineries and restaurants in the area. The main reason for my visit is to dine at SingleThread, but Iâ€™m also looking to explore the fantastic wine scene and other great dining spots while Iâ€™m there.

Specifically, Iâ€™m interested in:

Wineries within a 30-minute drive of Healdsburg that focus on Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. Iâ€™d love to visit a mix of both premium and boutique (smaller, family-run) wineries.

Restaurant recommendations beyond SingleThread that highlight the best of the region's cuisine. Whether itâ€™s a cozy spot for breakfast, a great lunch spot, or an unforgettable dinner experience, Iâ€™m open to suggestions!

Perhaps a slightly wacky question, but I need you, Reddit hive mind!

This is for a movie project Iâ€™m working on. The movie deals with generational divides and similarities at large, which is illustrated through various avenues, one of which being food and wine.

There are two subplot characters who get in a whole thing walking through different wine stores/looking at wine lists (probably the former but possibly the latter), with the younger character being super into natural wine and the older character being into (everyday) classics. For the natural wines I have a list already, including bottles like some Pheasantâ€™s Tears from Georgia, Bonhommeâ€™s Telquel, Meinklang Weisser Mulatschak, Gabrio Bini, Tissot, Matassa, EnvÃ­nate,â€¦

My question is: what are the equivalent producers in conventional winemaking? So not Barefoot, La Vieille Ferme, 19 Crimes, or Yellowtail, but what are some labels that the audience would recognise both visually and as good, solid (maybe even outstanding) bottles?

The oak is expertly managed by Sylvain Pataille, who proves to be a great winemaker. On the palate, there's a distinct minerality that pairs well with a nice salinity. The finish is very long.
A great white wine, after all, it comes from one of the best crus of the appellation.

The Maranges 1er Cru La FussiÃ¨re 2020 is exceptional. In my opinion, the Domaine is among the best in the appellation. It can already be drunk now. On the nose, it's elegant with notes of wild strawberries and cherries, followed by a sensation of pomegranate, then flowers along with a clear balsamic note and mint. On the palate, it's smooth with its small silky tannins. The precise fruit melds with iodine notes and an elegant minerality. Long finish. A wine that still has many years ahead of it.â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹",0.024,0.809,0.167,0.9846,not_negative,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

1g64iob,wine,"Colchagua Valley Cruisin' I've spent the last two days driving around Colchagua Valley in Chile and wanted to share some of my experience. I did some hurried research before this trip, but based on what I saw on this sub, there's room for more info to be put out there for the benefit of anyone thinking about a tour.

First, some logistics: Colchagua Valley is about a 2:30hr drive from Santiago Airport. Renting a car and making the drive is pretty easy - drive on the right like in the States, tolls are almost all taken care of electronically (like EZPass/SunPass) and are included in the rental price. Have some cash in case you find a booth that requires it. Be careful of surprise school zones with accompanying speed humps in the middle of a 70kph road.

There are a few towns that serve as anchor points in the valley. I stayed at a lovely hotel outside of Santa Cruz, Hotel Noi Blend. Super quiet in the middle of the vineyard fields, but not part of a winery. 

If you look at a map, you'll see a crescent-shaped mountain range just northeast of Santa Cruz. I basically did a lap around that. The landscape is beautiful with the Andes in the distance, and it's generally a fun drive.

I hit two wineries because I arrived in the afternoon Day 1, and Day 2 was kind of a trek. I booked in advance with Clos de Apalta (sister label of Lapostolle, actually their premium label), and ViÃ±a Vik. Both times, it was just myself and my wife on the English speaking tour. This seems to be an area more frequented by Latin American tourists. I would HIGHLY recommend knowing some Spanish, because almost no one speaks English outside of Santiago. I'm not saying that as a demonstration of anglophone privilege, it's just a fact this far away from the English-speaking world.

Winery impressions: Clos de Apalta was beautiful. They clearly care a lot about their process. Instead of steel tanks for fermentation, they use MASSIVE 7,500 liter oak barrels that they change every few years. Annual production is 20k cases. Lapostolle uses steel and cranks out 120k. The 7-story gravity system is some pretty remarkable engineering and really worth seeing. They also claim to have the oldest Carmanere vines in the region dating back to 1907.

ViÃ±a Vik has a bit more of a haughty air. Steel tanks everywhere but under a very impressive building. They import precut French oak to build their own barrels, which they then smoke with Chilean oak for a more subtle flavor. It was a cool process to see, but not quite the ""ooh-aah"" that I got with Clos. Their restaurant was very fine dining with a prix fix menu at $75pp, which includes two glasses of wine.

Wine impressions: I found out that I really like Carmenere! It's a brighter grape on the tongue but has lots of depth to it. I'm not an oenephile but I do have something of a palette, so I'll try my best here. Clos Apalta had three wines that we tried. Le Petit Clos 2020 was fun, everyday drinkable. It's the ""little brother"" of their major eponymous wine. Clos Apalta 2020 and 2012 were next. Even the guide agreed that the 2020 needed more time to mature. The 2012 was definitely a FULL expression of Carmenere, almost too much. Overall, we thought they were all delicious but would've aged the 2020 more.

ViÃ±a Vik had us try straight-from-the-barrel pours of Cab Sav and Carmenere to get a handle on the grape. Then we tried Milla Cala (our favorite), Vik the namesake, and La Piu Belle. Milla Cala was again, fun and drinkable. Not something you have to sit there and ponder over, but something to be enjoyed in the moment. I hope that makes sense. Vik was heavy and required time to chew on. Crazy long finish. Piu Belle was nice, but we tried their rosÃ© during dinner and that was SO much better. Overall, I think ViÃ±a Vik won the tasting contest.

Anyways, I hope this helps anyone looking to head out that way. It certainly opened my eyes to the better possibilities of Chilean wines. And there were TONS more wineries to explore, so I'll have to come back.

1g6h6i2,wine,"Can minerality come from unwashed grapes? Hey guys!

I'm new to studying wine (I've done WSET Level 2 and CMS intro and I'm currently studying for both WSET 3 and CMS certified). I keep getting hung up on the concept of minerality. I know minerality in wine is a highly contested topic, the main argument being that grapes will not absorb the flavors of the soil they are grown in simply by being grown in them. Of course, this argument makes sense, but I'm having difficulty accepting that there is absolutely no correlation, given how certain wines do have minerality which can be percepted (even being able to differentiate between salinity, wet rock, limestone, flint, etc). 

After realizing most grapes aren't washed before fermentation, the logical conclusion that keeps coming into my brain is that the flavors are imparted from the organic matter left on the skins of the grapes.  I mean, if I dunk anything in salt water and then eat it, it should have a hint of saltiness, right? If I seasoned a piece of meat and left it to marinate for a few days, even if I rinsed it off before I cooked it, there should definitely be a lingering presence of the seasonings, no? I feel like this is definitely an over simplification that should have been mentioned and disproved by now, but I'm having trouble finding anything that talks about the difference washing grapes can make on flavor- everything I find focuses on native yeast and the effects on spontaneous fermentation. Please let me know if there are any materials (lectures, books, etc) that mention this/if I'm going crazy

1g6iqgw,wine,"Champagne type choice? When we were married we were given bottles of champagne, nothing fancy but those 'higher end supermarket' wines. There was a Moet, a Taittinger and one other I cannot remember. 

We opened one with the birth of each child and it became a mini tradition. Now we are having our fourth (and hopefully final haha) child and I wanted another bottle to continue the tradition. I was very tempted to go crazy and buy something like a Krug GC 171 but it's very hard to justify when I probably wouldn't appreciate it.

So I want a decent Â£50-100 bottle of 'celebration' wine and came across Eric Rodez wines while searching for options and they sound nice. 

The problem is that there are loads of choices (sweetness levels, BbB, BbN etc) and I have no real experience of selecting champagne.

A birth year gift to my brother from Uncle Sandyâ€™s cellar. Opened with low expectations, pleasantly surprised 

Soft cork came out with very little fight, a bit crumbled so decanted

Ruby center, red-orange rim

Surprising amount of fruit still alive in the nose with cherries, prunes and a hint of past its prime age that follows, almost a dusty/earthy scent. Dried flowers. 

Palate: a bit of tar up front, fruit behind, stems/stalks/earthiness. Faint oakiness which is more like Bamboo cedar than a vanilla. 

Not a classic Pinot noir flavor from my experience. 

Tart acidity, light body, dry w/ soft tannins

Nice balance

1g5o5mp,wine,"Thanksgiving help: Great American wines under 60$ a bottle I am Dutch visiting family in the USA for thanksgiving. The entire Dutch side is coming over and everybody expects me to handle the wine. I thought it would be nice to try some American wines over there as they are a bit overpriced and also rare on this side of the pond. That's why I was hoping people could give me some recommendations, preferably available for shipping to Florida. I am not a fan of topheavy overripe raisinny or oxidative wines, US wines I have tried and loved are Sandhi and Evening land(Raj Parr fan I guess). So slightly reductive, fresher and more nuanced/elegant styles I guess. Your recommendations would really mean a lot to me as US wine really is a bit of a blind spot and people on this subreddit seem so incredibly knowledgeable about them! I put the categories I'm looking for and some ideas I have had below. 60$ is not a hard limit but if I can keep the average around 50 a bottle I would be very happy.

(Edit: I find US wines to be a bit overpriced in the Netherlands specifically, there are many markets where they are great value and even some offer exceptional value in my country, just to be clear I am not a hater.)

Categories I'm looking for(and wines I am thinking of):

Sparkling: No clue :( I like a lot of lees and blanc de noir is generally a plus

Light white: No clue :( Big fan of Saumur Chenin, Silex Sancerre, Timorasso, Aligote or basically everything. Have not often liked new world Sauvignon Blanc though, tends to be a bit fruit heavy. Family doesnt like Riesling which is sad. Really not too aware of American whites outside of Chard and SauvB so anything cool/niche that comes to mind would be great!

Big white: Sandhi Santa Rita Hills Chardonnay(have not tried other bottlings), Bodega Chacra Mainque(found a good price am open to US equivalents)

Light Red: Evening Land Eloa Amity Hills Seven Springs Pinot Noir

Big Red: No clue :( I specifically do not want Cabernet or Merlot, was thinking some Syrah or GSM blends would be cool any other recommendations also more than welcome! Something structured with vibrant fruit and good balance would be appreciated :) Edit: Am really interested in varietal Syrah bottlings actually, any good producers? Looking at Mark Ryan wild eyes and L'ecole no 41 estate syrah right now, but I do not know the producers.

Dessert wine always a bonus :P (Edit: Riesling would be fine in a dessert wine, apologies for being unclear)

Thank you so much in advance and good luck with your thanksgiving plans <3

1g62w3h,wine,"Wine Cooler/Fridge Advice Needed for Unconventional Reason! Greetings fellow oenophiles!

Sadly, when I moved out of my last home nearly 2 years ago, we were unable to lug our ancient beast of a 300-400 bottle wine storage vault up the stairs of our 115 yr-old home and therefore had to include it as a ""feature"" of the sale (it worked btw!). We also had to drain my collection of fine wines prior to and after the sale since we didn't have a great place to store them in our ""new"" 110 yr-old home that we are now doing a full gut reno on. It was truly a VERY painful endeavor.  :)  My liver is still recovering, ha!

Anyway, here's an unusual question for you: I need a temperature and humidity-controlled space in which to store my dahlia tubers over the winter after I dig them out of the ground. A **single-zone** wine fridge/cooler with roughly a minimum of 36-48 bottle capacity (but bigger is always better), preferably less than $1000 US, and A STABLE TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY unit is what I need (temps in the 40s-50 F). I don't care if it's damn ugly, free-standing, etc., as it will be in my basement and have a temperature and humidity monitor in it. I cannot over-emphasize how important the stability of the temperature and humidity are. I have thousands of dollars invested in these tubers (not to mention all of the love and sweat equity that goes with gardening), so I cannot afford to lose them. 

As a trial, I bought one on Amazon during Prime Days last week for about $300 (by Antarctic) and have been monitoring the temps/humidity daily based on different temp settings ranging from 42-50 F. It has frankly been very disturbing. The photo shows the 3 monitors I had placed in it when I set the wine fridge at 43 F. (Note: I put the 2nd digital monitor and regular thermometer in 2 days later in order to ensure that the original digital monitor was accurate.) Bottom line: this unit is a piece of sh\*t due to the wild variations, and I didn't even mention the condensation on the inside. I will try to initiate a return to Amazon. Sigh...

Based on this, can you please provide me with your recommendations? I've been looking at TONS of reviews on-line in every place imaginable, but there doesn't appear to be a consensus. Again, I need a single-zone unit. Do you have any knowledge about the Cosmo 24"" 48-bottle unit (approx. $880 US)? It seems to get good reviews, but I'm doubtful of everything at this point. I'll take any and all recommendations, as I have to begin my harvest soon!

PS I don't want to buy a used unit on FB Marketplace, Craigslist, etc., as I don't want to take any further chances with reliability, etc.

However photos of him on the podium show a different style label on the neck.

1g4hddg,wine,"What's the funniest or supidest experience you've have while drinking wine or opening a bottle? List them! My personal faves:

1. My friend and her mom were visiting me, was their last night in Paris so we decided to open a bottle of wine and enjoy the view of the Eiffel tower. But we forgot a corkscrew, all the shops were closed, and for some reason nobody we asked had one. So we decided to come up with a plan, I would hold the bottle and jam a stick into the cork, and my friend would step on it. I did it before. Well, this time the bottle instantly exploded and lacerated my hand pretty badly, so the romantic sunset was cut short because we had to go wash my bloody and and arm off. Also because it was an air b' n b, there was nothing in the apartment so I just wrapped it in toilet paper.

2. Using 'the Breton method' to open a bottle of wine...once again, no bottle opener. So you take a shoe, put the bottle in it, and tap or bang it against a concrete wall. Worked like a charm and the night was saved! 

3. I was drinking some champagne with two or three friends in CafÃ© Oz. The bartenders started spraying champagne into the bar for a bit of entertainment, which is fun, but they accidentally sprayed my friend right in the face and her hair was soaked haha. She was not happy about that, but it was still funny. Then a few minutes later some crazy Australians threw like two beer bottles and they exploded on the wall right above us.

4. A friend's younger brother wanted to open a wine bottle, I said no, let me do it. He insisted. The cork flew up right in his face (literally flinging his hair on his forehead up) then bounced around everywhere. He dad also opened a bottle of wine/champagne with a sabre-like knife a few times, which was pretty cool.",0.068,0.734,0.199,0.9946,not_negative,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

* **(1) Would you add anything else to ""basics/classics?"" these?** Gamay? Cab Franc? Merlot?

I want to get a strong sense of what is typical for these grapes. Thus,

* **(2) How many wines should I (reasonably) drink of each grape?**

>-> Obviously if I had unlimited time and budget, I would drink as many as possible, but I also don't think these grapes will be my favorites (right now I like things like Moscato d'Asti, Albarino, and orange wines, to be honest). So I am thinking 3-5? But I'm also mostly working on this alone, so I will probably waste lots of these bottles, especially if I'm trying to do them simultaneously? **(Is there any way to buy tiny wines, like the half bottles, or maybe you'd recommend I just go to a wine bar and drink glasses, so I'd pay the same prices but not waste?)**

* **(3) Of the number of wines I'm targetting for each grape, would you recommend focusing on just one region?**

>-> For instance, I could just drink French for all of these grapes; or for something like Pino Gris, which seems majority Italian, I could exclusively drink Italian? I think I'm trying to get a ""pure"" comparison

* **(4) Or is the idea more to drink one typical cheap one of the grape, one typical expensive wine of the grape, and a few weird category-stretching ones** (e.g., make sure to taste a ""typical"" stainless steel chardonnay in addition typical oak-aged ones)?
* **(5) How can I predict in advance whether a given wine will teach me about typicality? I would love specific recommendations for three typical chardonnays, for instance. Or is this the kind of thing to just ask at a wine shop, rather than on Reddit?**

1g490er,wine,"Tasting: all over the place, or one consistent theme? Iâ€™m having a small tasting with friends tomorrow and was planning to do three Rieslings, three Chardonnays, and three Riojas. The idea was to start off with the Rieslings as broad, accessible wines, then move into the Chardonnays, and finally once theyâ€™re all a few glasses in they will perhaps start to appreciate a good Gran Reserva :) 

That said, I know itâ€™s a common opinion that in a tasting you should keep the wines fairly similar and stick to one consistent theme. Personally, I like tasting a bunch of different things and I think it helps you figure out what you really like, but I can also understand the argument that you will only really understand a wine in the context of other similar wines. Thereâ€™s also the fact that the order of the wines matters, I donâ€™t want the Riesling to make the Chardonnay seem flabby or the Rioja to be too intense after the Chardonnay.

1g4whwd,wine,"Bad taste, no matter Hi everybody, hoping you can solve a problem Iâ€™ve had trouble finding answers on google for. 

For the past two years, occasionally, maybe 10 times a year, weâ€™ll have a white wine at home, freshly bought from the fridge from a different bottle shop each time, and different brands and price ranges from cheap to expensive too.  Iâ€™ve found no correlation in the wine type, brand, cost or store where itâ€™s from. 

Weâ€™ve even stored wine in different fridges, but itâ€™s always a random wine. Weâ€™ll drink the first half of the bottle but the second half will generally taste like acid, make us gag, and generally there will be crystals in the bottom of the glass.

If you try to drink it, youâ€™ll vomit. If you add a mixer, it cannot mask the taste and youâ€™ll gag. 

Iâ€™ve asked a few people and Iâ€™ve been told tartrate crystals donâ€™t impact taste. The wine does not smell, and it is not kept outside of the fridge or open very long (max 3 days, sometimes shared in the same night and cannot be finished due to the issue). 

Whatâ€™s happening? Is there anything we can do to avoid it or is this supply chain issues?

1g3mivd,wine,"The bulk of US wine acreage comes from the hot dry CA Central Valley - almost entirely planted with the wrong varieties The Central Valley grows 70% of California wine grapes, and California grows 80% of US grapes. This region alone counting for over half of US wine production (56%)! The area has a reputation for low quality wine, which doesn't seem too surprising given the mismatch between what's planted and what the climate is. The three varieties that come out as quality are Zinfandel, Petite Syrah, and Barbera - ALL warm southern varieties.

Looking at what's grown, it appears that some group of 'experts' made a bunch of horrible decisions decades ago to fill the region with a bunch of cool climate northern French varieties, because that was what consumers recognized. It's the same stuff as grown on the coast, except the coast is obviously going to do cool better.

Looking at Wine Folly's grape list [https://winefolly.com/grapes/](https://winefolly.com/grapes/), there's TONs of Spanish, Italian, Hungarian, Greek white and red varieties. Why the heck aren't these planted in the Central Valley? Where's the Xinomavro, Savatiano, Nero dâ€™Avola, Moschofilero? That's the type of stuff that should grow well.

People gripe about CA wine being either cheap crap or too expensive. I don't think the Coast is going to get cheaper, but I think there should be huge potential for the cheap crap to get good. The old world figured out what grew where and optimized. Seems like the US is still very much in trial and error phase.

By dinner it was just perfect. Dusty red cherries with a lovely hint of cedar and spice with mouthwatering acidity and really nice tannins.

I am a wine sales rep in a metropolitan city. A very small company and this is my first job in the industry. Currently my pay structure is 99% commission (i basically dont get paid a base salary). I want to ask all of you in the wine industry; is this normal?

Again i work for a small company, unknown fine wines (theyre great wines tho), and i feel like i was taken advantage of while onboarding for this company. Its my first ""adult"" job if you will. Most of my pay *will* come from commission and i say that because i havent recieved any of my sales commission yet since it takes a while for that commission to come in. 

Since starting, I have opened new accounts, I dont get a current account list or any helpful resources for accounts. 

My commission isnt extravagantly high. I have a smaller portfolio and only really sell wine. I havent gotten to form a relationship yet to get good placements with on-premise accounts to do any by the glass programs, which is expected. 

I know for many other distribution/ supplier companies, sales reps or something of this nature with commission usually has a base pay.

At a grocery store in Georgetown found a decent selection. A better priced bottle and from France, perfect! It must taste good. Grab 2 Merlots from the same company it appeared. (Did a lot of shopping so only a brief look.)

Later when opened, we were disappointed it tasted mostly like fruit juice. My wife said like a cheap bottled sangria from the store. Sip more, look at bottles more....1 of them (pictured,) has a spelling error on the back. Alarmed, we start looking the bottles over, googling about fake alcohol which we have heard about. Of course find horror stories online but, doesn't seem like what we have.

Then, she screams out "" omg there's another label under it.."" Basically, there's a near transparent label below the label on the back that really only shows up with a light shining on it. Although the white labels clearly say they're from France, and mention the specific region....the wine is from Malaysia, and it's fruit juice and additives.

We really don't know what to say. Shocked, upset, glad we weren't poisoned by what it could have been we suppose. So now don't even know where to share this but want to because this is 1. Interesting and terrible 2.somehow want to let others know this can happen.

I'm feeling I need a bit of a change in my boozing, and have gotten my every-few-years itch for wine. I started looking into wines again and just figured I'd get a comment or two here if possible to address - 

* I am an IPA fan from early in my career. I know I don't have an interest in particularly sweet wines, but are there any types/genres/brands of wines you'd recommend from this as a starting point?
* How well does wine keep after opening? I can go through a six pack in a weekend or a week, and I don't know how well opened wine keeps. Is it best to finish a bottle within a night or two, or is it fine for 5+ days?
* My biggest pain point for getting into wine is that I find the taste to be predominantly ""alcohol"" in the same way I find a beer over 10-11%. Something like tequila I can often enjoy for just the taste despite it obviously being higher %. Is this just a case of acquiring a taste for wine? Or is it something like ""oh you've only had X wine, or only had cheap wine""? Because if anything I'd rather get a bottle of wine for cheaper than a 6 pack, or at least to have it last longer glass-to-can.

2004 Vintage Longbottom Henry's Drive Shiraz, Padthaway, Australia. 

Translucent ruby with a fairly clear rim.

Very vibrant nose showing juicy red plum, nectarine, anise, eucalyptus, and cotton candy.

Juicy on the palate as well, with red plum, nectarine, licorice.  Surprisingly youthful and fresh fruit forward wine for a 2004.  The clarity of the wine and very light tannins is quite different from most Australian Shiraz I've tried which has been much more concentrated and extracted. 

Ultimately, I felt like I was drinking an almost artificial juice beverage (Capri-Sun?) rather than wine.

1g2ndrf,wine,"The wines of Heredad MorÃ¡n & LÃ³pez, Bierzo  We visited this winery by chance while in the region. They just finished the harvest and we were welcomed in the room with fermentors. Very clean and wonderfully smelling.
Briefly talked to the winemaker, he also has a background in chemical engineering. Very promising.

We blindly bought some wines and tasted them at home. This was a gamble but we were confident because of the good impression we had of the winery.

No regrets! The buleza rosado is 100% mencia with some skin contact. It needs a small decant and then shows bright fruit, a hint of acidity and a very strong finish. Serious yet very easy to drink rose. This is what a good rose should be. Look at that colour!

We also bought the heredad 26 mencia and heredad 26 godello. While I liked the mencia, the godello is the star. It has a lot of depth while retaining freshness. I only regret not buying more.

We also have their top red, Rincon de heredad but did not taste it yet.

This is a relatively new project. Given the quality, pedigree of the winemaker, and prizes they already get, I see them getting more popular and expensive in the near future.

Deep opaque ruby-purple with a thin reddish rim.

1g33xrk,wine,"Where to Order Wine in BC I recently moved to BC and am struggling to find where I can order wine to be shipped to me. I don't live in Vancouver so what's available locally is limited. Actually, it's not since I live in the Okanagan but I'm wanting to explore wines from the rest of the world (working through WSET list) and most of what I can get here is Okanagan wine.

  
I used to live in Calgary and ordered from Zyn (as well as went in person) all the time. Free shipping, great selection, and prices lower than anywhere else. It seems like Zyn may ship to BC but I think it's technically against the law since it's coming from a different province.

  
I've found Marquis Wine Cellars but not much else. Any suggestions? Do I just need to plan trip to Vancouver?

  
The BC Liquor Store website has a great selection but unfortunately it doesn't let you order online or to be transferred to the BCL stores around me. I only lets me see stock around the province and annoyingly doesn't let me filter by what's available at a particular location. I've mainly been shopping at Jak's and the BCL in Penticton but their selection is fairly limited (and Jak's is pricy).

1g2kbg9,wine,"Pommard Domaine Ami AMI is a tiny wine business founded in 2014 by two close friends, Willy Roulendes and Paul Marchand-Perarnau. The former was an oenologist with experience in Burgundy, while the latter worked at Domaine Hauvette (Provence) before becoming a sommelier and wine wholesaler in London.

Their interventions in the cellar are minimal, with short and light maceration for red wines and no use of new barrels.
This Pommard 1er Cru Les Poutures has been released under their label since 2017.

When first opened, the nose was austere, with gaseous sensations. But after a while, contact with air changed the wine, bringing out the fruit, leather aromas, and spicy notes. Time further improved the wine, and the nose clearly reveals scents of violet, raspberries, and licorice. On the palate, it is elegant with its light tannins and a nice refreshing minerality in the finish.â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹",0.01,0.875,0.114,0.9517,not_negative,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It needs to be 

24 inch under counter built in fridge (front vent).

Preferably one zone (but two if it has to be)

Have a compressor

Be stainless steel

Hold about 44 or more bottles

Easy to move shelves

Cost $1600 or less (preferably lessâ€¦..)

Have always wanted to try Auvenay as some would say it's some of the best white wines in the world.

Caramel popcorn, struck matches, orange marmalade, white blossoms on the nose. The aromatics are insane.

On the palate, honey, a diffused citrus blend of lemons with oranges, some orange marmalade, a bit of cooked fruits, orange peel, crushed rocks, and a hint of baking spices. The honeyed mineral orange peel mix flows into the long finish, which glides down effortlessly. The finish balances out the honey caramel popcorn in the front of the palate so well that it keeps you reaching for the next sip. The wine feels decadent but light at the same time.

As it airs, more of that honeyed marmalade sensation comes out. 

One thing that I feel like it's missing is a bit of fruit and fruit intensity, but that might be because of the terroir.

I didnâ€™t see a recent post about hills to die on so, why not start a new one. Hereâ€™s mine. Please let me know if you agree or not.

The wine hill I will die on is that blends are not more â€˜sophisticatedâ€™ or â€˜nuancedâ€™ or â€˜complexâ€™ than monocÃ©pages. I have heard this from both experienced and novice drinkers. My rationalization is that wines contain dozens of chemical compounds that determine taste and mouthfeel (can you taste colour?). (Chemically even hundreds, but most are trace amounts.) Does it really matter if you have 50 chemical compounds in a wine or 100? I would say no. Does â€˜valueâ€™ (I know, prices can be absurd, but letâ€™s assume wines can be valued more or less objectively) have anything to say here? And since many of the most valuable wines are monocÃ©pages (DRC to name just the most obvious), they are clearly not valued less than blends.

1gt46gp,wine,"Splurge Review! 2006 Cheval Des Andes A few weeks back, I asked this sub which wine at my shop I should splurge on. The two wines that were most recommended were a 2018 Isole et Olena Ceparello and a 2016 Beaucastel CdP. While both of those wines look amazing and fall within my desired price range, I wanted a wine that would be a bit more approachable for the people I intended to share it with, meaning something with a little more age that required less decanting and didnâ€™t need to be paired with a meal to be truly appreciated. This 2006 Cheval Des Andes fit the bill perfectly, not to mention it was personally recommended by people whose opinions I trust.

""Cheval des Andes is the result of the union between ChÃ¢teau Cheval Blanc, Premier Grand Cru ClassÃ© â€œAâ€ of Saint Emilion, Bordeaux and Terrazas de los Andes, a pioneer of cool-climate, high-altitude winemaking in Argentina. Distinguished by its freshness, elegance and exceptional ageing potential, the wine of Cheval des Andes is the Grand Cru of the Andes.â€

Notes:

Such complexity right out of the bottle. Aromas of green peppercorn, dried leaves, tobacco, vanilla, roasted nuts, and dates. Itâ€™s all knit together around core of blackberry, but itâ€™s subtle, there in the background. 

With about an hour in the glass, the nose comes across warmer and and much more integrated. Iâ€™m getting tobacco, vanilla, hazelnuts, dates, cherry, and star anise. Really lovely. 

An hour and a half later, a lot of the same, but a thereâ€™s a distinct note of rich cocoa.

The palate is well-balanced, delicious, but a bit less expressive than the nose. As youâ€™d expect for a wine of this age, the acidity and tannins have mellowed, but for my taste, itâ€™s lacking structure. I was hoping for a little more power and a little more grip, just enough to give this wine a longer-lasting finish. That being said, itâ€™s still tasty and perfectly enjoyable, and at $70, I feel itâ€™s money well spent. Right out of the bottle, Iâ€™m getting notes of tobacco, blackberry, dried red fruit, licorice, and cloves. The fruit comes back to life the more this wine breathes. 

Verdict:

Loved it. Not perfect, but truly enjoyable, and so fun to share with good company. 93 points.

I appreciate a great bottle, vallue the experience of sharing in good company but am also happy to lower my pretentiousness and have a great night with a lot of good, affordable red. Why do I think I am I good at it? No headaches, hangovers, reason to doubt my choices of the night before - regardless of abundance and quality. Typically I go for  Italian and Austrian wines...

I travel to the US Frequently. All is different there. Contrary to popular notion, I think american wine tends to be extremely tastefull and creative. A flavourful Zinfandel is a great drink. However, it ruins my trips. After three glasses (or two bottles allike), it punishes me the next day. Relentlessly! Every single time.

I really only drink beer (mostly seasonal stuff) and hard liquor (mostly whiskey, bourbon, tequila) but there are some nights where I feel it would be nice to crack open a bottle of wine and enjoy it with dinner (something I think I literally have never done). I made a nice ribeye steak dinner last night and had a guest over and I thought to myself I wish I could have brought out a nice bottle of something to go with it.

The only wine I drink sometimes is when my wife gets Wolffer Estate Summer in a Bottle (a rosÃ©).

If you could recommend 1 bottle of each - red, white, rosÃ© - which would you recommend?

Preferably something not too hard to find and nothing too pricey (maybe $50 to $100 max).

Chateau Lascombes is one of five 2nd growths in Margaux and is a mile west of Chateau Margaux. 1973 was a wet and hot season with a large, underripe crop. From what I understand, this is still a Cabernet weighted blend, bottled before Lascombes switched to Merlot based blends for their more modern vintages.

Quickly turns predominantly earthy though with heavy olive, tea leaves, tobacco, dried Italian herbs, bit of leather, and some mint on the finish. It is medium bodied at this point with medium plus acidity and low-medium tannins that are velvety at best. Such a smooth, earthy finish that lingers.

My question - I assume there are additives for both color and the back end sweetness? What are they, and why? And for California wines in general, is there any way to identify whether the wine has additives vs a true expression of the grape/terroir?

My shop is considering bringing it in, so no price on it yet, but it will probably be somewhere in the $40-60 range. 

Notes:

Straight out of the bottle, the nose is pretty savory and rustic, showing off a bright core of raspberry, cherry and vanilla. Within 30 minutes, these aromas mellow out into a lovely bouquet of black currant, cherry, dark chocolate, chili pepper and peppercorn. Thereâ€™s a subtle floral element here too, but itâ€™s tough to identify. 

On the palate, notes of red cherry, strawberry, red bell pepper, and a touch of black pepper. Bright acidity is balanced against very fine tannins. This is a light and lively wine, but it still comes across as well-extracted, and the finish is long-lasting. Iâ€™m not experienced at scoring wines, but Iâ€™d give this lovely Austrian blend 92 points.",0.02,0.788,0.192,0.9886,not_negative,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

From 2017 onwards the estate has started using polymer and glass amphoras to age part of the wine to maintain freshness. I visited the estate this summer and its beautiful!

45min of air before assessing. 
Color: Deep dark red with garnet rim.
Nose: Very complex with dark fruits and spice. Lingonberry, ripe cassis, blackberry, blueberry , cedar. At this point in its development there is light cinnamon bread notes such as cinnamon, clove and nutmeg. Just a hint of funk / garrigue in the background.

Taste: Wine is open, medium+ / full bodied, polished and smooth. Tannins are still quite present, but showing first signs of being resolved. The dark fruited taste follows the nose. Very complex and long. Still developing as it gets air in the glass.

Long life ahead of this wine, but its showing beautifully open right now.

We are a team of students currently working on our final Bachelor Project, and we would love your help!

**Project Topic**  
Our project explores the drinking habits of younger generations, focusing on alcoholic beverages and their alternatives. For some time we've seen a decline in wine consumption among people aged 20â€“30 compared to previous generations at the same age. To better understand why this shift is happening, weâ€™ve put together a quick 5-minute anonymous survey.

**Goal**  
Our goal is to uncover the reasons behind this trend and find ways to inspire younger generations to choose wine as their preferred drink once again. To achieve this, we would greatly appreciate it if you could take a few minutes to complete our survey.

Letâ€™s bring wine back into the spotlight!ðŸ¥‚ðŸ¾

Iâ€™ve been asked to lead a fun wine tasting session that combines an intro to wine tasting with an exploration of a few tasty finger lakes wines. The parameters - I need to serve 6 wines, and the average price per bottle should be $20 dollars. 

Iâ€™m automatically thinking Riesling will be the star of the show, and I can do a comparison of dry to off-dry or sweet/late harvest. I also want to have at least one sparkling, because damn the finger lakes are popping off with sparklers the last decade or so. I know nothing about reds in the area (other than Dr. Frank seperavi) but people will expect at least one. Gewurztraminer also seems like it could be fun to include, as an iconic grape of the region that not as many people are familiar with.

I would love to showcase multiple wineries, and to feature wines that let me make easy 101 comparisons. Oaked/unoaked, low vs high acid or sugar, vintage v non, etc. 

I have a ton of ideas, but let me know if you have any thoughts! Iâ€™ll be traveling to the finger lakes in December, and the tasting event is in January.

1grrsyu,wine,"Thought it was pretty funny. Some clueless glaikit tried out Buckfast An American wine connoisseur made the mistake of reviewing buckfast. Tasting notes:

Buckfast Tonic Wine (No Vintage)

Screw cap, took it off about 30 minutes before to bring in some air. Apparently made by monks in England. Decided to try while cooking dinner. Poured into a glass, first glance has a very inky almost brownish color that you see in older wines. Very syrupy, liquid clings to the side of the glass when swirled. Almost 15% ABV.

Stuck my nose in and was hit with something I've never experienced before. Barnyardy funk (in a bad way) almost like a dead animal in a bird's nest. A mix of flat Coca Cola and caramel with a whiff of gun metal.

On the palate, overwhelming sweetness and sugar. Cherry Cola mixed with Benadryl. Unlike anything I've tasted. I'm not sure what this liquid is but it is not wine, I'm actually not sure what it is but it tastes like something a doctor would prescribe. A chemical concoction of the highest degree. Can only compare it to a Four Loko.

Managed to make it through a couple small glasses but not much more. Has absolutely ruined the evening drinking-wise for me as I tried to drink a nice Bordeaux after but the iron-like metallic sweet aftertaste I just couldn't get out of my mouth even after a few glasses of water. I don't drink a lot of coffee regularly so I also have mild heart palpitations from the caffeine after just drinking a bit of this and feel a slight migraine.

An ungodly concoction made by seemingly godly men. I believe the Vatican needs to send an exorcist over to Buckfast Abbey as the devil's works are cleary present there. After tasting this ""wine,"" the way I feel can only be described as akin to being under a bridge on one's knees orally pleasing a vagrant while simultaneously drinking liquified meth through a dirty rag.

My friend enjoys red wine and from what I know, prefers:

* medium bodied wines (but doesn't mind full bodied wines over dinner)
* isn't overly sweet or dry (though I do suspect they like drier wines?) 
* has some complexity -- not sure what that means, does that mean some tannins? 

When we go out drinking and we have wine, my friend has mentioned enjoying really smooth red wines during their dinners? I'd ideally like to buy a red wine bottle that hopefully they would enjoy and priced around $75 to $150.

Chateau Suduiraut 2015

Tasted over the course of 3 days. 

Eye: radiant gold. 

Nose: intense burnt caramel, orange peel, marzipan. 

Mouth: opulent in the extreme. Vibrant acidity, highly complex and incredibly dense, initially follows the nose, soon accompanied by white peach, honeysuckle, scuppernong. I can still taste the sip I took 5 minutes ago. 

Continued to blossom over the three days, and if anything was clearer and more intense on day 3.

* Nose: Red fruits, raspberries, blackberries, no perceptible alcohol
* Palate: Medium to low body, feels light on the palate, a little bit of pleasant acidity, mostly purple and red fruits, blackberries, round tannins, and dried herbs (maybe thyme)
* ABV: 14.5%
* Price: $18
* Food pairings: Fettuccine with ragÃ¹ Bolognese (really nice), Detroit-style pepperoni pizza, mild Italian sausage and tomato pasta, spiced kebabs and tehina on rice (best pairing)
* Overall rating: 6/10 (very good, a cut above)

Bottle says *bottled* by ""Vignobles & Compagnie"" (Suckling also has them as the producer), but I can't find this expression on their site. They do make a CdP with Grenache and Syrah.

Occasionally, it's fun to spend a bit more and try something of higher quality or more renowned. For these, I'm either doing some research ahead of time or talking to the somm in the store. 

As a new father, I thought it would be a fun treat to get a nice bottle when I finished my paternity leave from work. I'll also probably splurge each time my retirement account hits certain marks.

* Day 1: Traditional (southern leaning) Thanksgiving dinner 
   * 2009 Occidental Cuvee Elizabeth Pinot noir (2 bottles)
   * 2020 Hermann J Wiemer HJW Bio Riesling (2 bottles) 
* Day 2: Make your own pizza 
   * 2013 Dom (2 bottles) 
   * I'm debating getting a red here, maybe a Rosso di Montalcino. I don't know how many people will just drink beer or cocktails with their pizza 
* Day 3: Grill night-This night will be a smaller group as some will leave. We'll probably have more steak than chicken but a selection of meats on the grill 
   * For red-I have a 2004 La Rioja Alta 890 that I wanted to open this weekend and I think this might be the night. I also have a 2009 Beaucastel cdp and a few youngish big cabs that I would be willing to take

The same is true in wine.  Anyone will taste major differences between wines, but in the broad section of ""paintings"" aka ""reds"", folks often get confused.

Beautifully balanced, its length in the mouth is notorious with impressive flavours of black fruits that persist on the palate.

\--

  
Very long overdue trip report. Thank you so much for all of the help from r/kelowna and r/wine! We stayed for a week, and targeted between 3-5 wineries per day. So many folks here helped us curate a list of places to visit, and we really appreciate you all.

Wineries we visited:

Cawston

* Crowsnest Vineyards
* Seven Stones Winery

Kelowna

* Priest Creek
* Quail's Gate
* Soma Craft Cidery
* Spearhead\*

Naramata

* Daydreamer\*
* Four Shadows
* Howling Bluff Estate Winery
* Kettle Valley
* Lang Vineyards
* Poplar Grove Winery

Okanagan Falls

* Meyer Family\*

Oliver & Osoyoos

* Bartier Brothers Vineyard & Winery
* Black Hills Estate Winery
* Culmina Family Estate Winery\*
* Fairview Cellars\*
* Phantom Creek

Summerland

* 8th Generation Vineyard
* Lightning Rock
* Solvero Wines\*

\*Highlights (very personal opinion though, we have something positive to say about all of them)

Overall, we had an amazing time. Summerland was the perfect spot for us to stay for the week, with easy access to wineries, trails, groceries, and the beach. I've marked our favourites above. Daydreamer, Fairview, and Meyer were particular highlights.

I feel that we got a good mix of different types of wineries, and have an extensive list of places we didn't get to go this time but would be very keen to visit.

Notable Wine and Tasting Notes

* There was no shortage of styles and varietals to try. We may have been biased in our winery selections. Typically it was cooler climate varietals, Burgundian, and it was rare to find blends.
* Lots of range in the varietals themselves. For example Syrah went from overwhelming black pepper, to barely any pepper if at all. The reluctant rose from Fairview stood out coming from a small planting of Syrah (which is sadly no longer there). The Syrah from Daydreamer, and bit less the Shiraz from the same location, was also great.
* After hearing about it, we asked for and we were allowed a free tasting of smoke tainted wine from Meyer which was quite the educational experience. Turns out you canâ€™t really taste or smell smoke from the juice. You can definitely taste and smell it after the wine has been made. Smelled like a newly painted room to me. Very obvious notes of some kind chemical on those nose but not at all pleasant in a way a Riesling would be. On the palette, the best way I could describe it would be if someone had infused the wine with tire smoke. To be clear, this was not representative of the wines from this winery in any way. They had some awesome chard and pinot.Â 
* Marechal Foch, a somewhat native hybrid grape, wasnâ€™t really our jam and tasted a bit like it too. It made for a surprisingly good port though at Lang Vineyards.
* Speaking of jam wines, there was also a fruit winery we literally stumbled into while looking for lunch at Sleeping Giant fruit winery. Tasted like what you would expect. Not a lot of nuance. All fruit forward, on the sweeter end but not too cloying. Apricot was probably our favourite. If Pie was a wine.
* Clos Du Soleil had some really nice Bordeaux blends. Very approachable, and easy to recommend to nearly anyone. Notably they also had their own take on a sauternes (called â€œSaturnâ€). No botrytis, but still a sweet wine with lots of complexity and a nice balance of acidity.
* For our palettes, we found the best QPR was from somewhat unsurprisingly, the smaller more quaint looking wineries. Not that we were shy from visiting the higher budget and bigger looking wineries.

Visiting Notes

* We had an â€œelevatedâ€ tour from Grape Escapes on the first day. It gave us a great initial impression of the range and variety. As we tasted it was also a great way to get suggestions to other wineries that might be more our style in both decor and palette.
* It cannot be stressed enough how many wineries there are. You could spend months trying wineries. If your visit is somewhat short you should try your best to choose carefully. The range in quality and styles can be quite large.
* The density of wineries in Naramata is certainly impressive, and we were very glad that we had a short list already ready. Suggestions from other wineries were always welcome.
* There is a wide range of wineries to choose from - some fancy, some down-to-earth, some in the middle. We were curious about the fancy ones like Quail's Gate and Phantom Creek, and were glad to visit. We enjoyed the more casual ones like Daydreamer and Fairview the most.
* Things were relatively quiet when we visited and it was likely due to a lack of harvest. Solvero Wines took us on an impromptu tour! Really lovely family-run place in a gorgeous setting.
* Fairview Cellars had a nice catalogue of back vintages and it was fun to try a bunch in succession, especially since the ownership has changed. Got to taste wines with 10 years apart between them.
* If we went back, we would want to visit Hidden Chapel. It is the new vineyard run by the previous winemaker from Fairview which was a big hit for us.
* Unfortunately the harsh conditions of the previous winter impacted the harvest, and it's been tough on many growers and workers. We saw many vineyards replanting, ripping out dead stock, etc. Weâ€™re curious how this will impact the region long term.
* We skipped Mirabel as they didn't have an appointment until relatively late in the day, and we were getting tired. But we ended up visiting a cidery (Soma Craft Cidery) which was much better than anticipated. And we got to feed alpacas, bonus!
* Everyone was absolutely lovely, and it felt very pleasant to be travelling to another part of Canada and still feel at home.
* Other than Quail's Gate, Blue Mountain, Mirabel, and Scout we had no trouble walking in for a tasting without calling ahead / scheduling. We aren't disappointed, as there were so many wonderful options but I think I'll coordinate the latter 3 on our next trip.
* The Spotted Lake down in Osoyoos was a very random stop. We turned the car around to go back and get a better look. If anyone goes to that area... I think it was worth a look.",0.05,0.769,0.181,0.9995,not_negative,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

1gqej9p,wine,"Recent premox situation with Pierre Morey? Iâ€™ve had a few bottles of Pierre Morey (not PYCM) recently and all of them were equally, more advanced than expected. They were 2 bottles of Terre Blanches 2019 and a bottle of Les Tessons 2019, and they all come from a reputed importer in my country and two different retailers so itâ€™s unlikely this is a storage issue.

Is Pierre Morey known for premox issue in recent vintages? The bottles are sealed with natural cork so I guess thatâ€™s possible but I havenâ€™t heard too much premox complaints about the producer, and itâ€™s very odd to think 3 out of 3 bottles are premoxed. That said the wine was already getting gold and it has completely lost its flinty reductive characters and the wine felt kinda fat if not completely tired.

I had a bottle of Les Tessons 2019 just 2 years ago and the wine was pretty flinty and structured so itâ€™s hard for me to believe the wine changes this much just in 2 years.

Iâ€™m 29 and recently got into collecting.
My local wine shop has a huge vintage section and itâ€™s in a low-income neighborhood so the deals are often ridiculous (for Canada/NA). Iâ€™ve read that Barolos and Barbarescos from 2019/2020 will be some of the best vintages and Iâ€™ve recently started collecting them when on sale. Admittedly these are some of the cheaper names in Barolo, but I have youth on my side. 

My question is: will almost all baroloâ€™s/barbarescoâ€™s from 2019/2020 appreciate by 2030 even if theyâ€™re from lesser names (but well reviewed) brands like: Fontanafreddo, Ellena Giuseppe, batasiolo, pertinance, enrico serrafino. Paid $30-40 CAD  per bottle. Am I crazy to think these will be in the ~$60/bottle by 2030?

Iâ€™m writing to ask for some help or direction in getting a basic slide show or information for a wine presentation. 

We live in a retirement community and are looking to have residents provide information along with a 5 or 6 wine tasting examples of whites to reds. 

We are not looking for an expensive experience. Wines we sample generally run the $20-40 range give or take. Mostly wines that can be purchased and enjoyed through our local wine supplier or larger consumer grocery. 

Examples of recent meetings was one focused on Lujon winery. Another was focused on some Eastern European wines from Croatia, Romania and Hungary as a group was traveling there. This summer we did one called Chillâ€™in and Grilliâ€™in, about reasonably priced wine to drink while enjoying summer entertaining. 

We do talk about foods that go with the wines from cheeses to spicy to meats to seafoods, etc. 

Any help you can provide, or if you point me to any other source for information would be greatly appreciated.

1gmk3bx,wine,"Wine preservation in HDPE bottles  We usually drink 100mg each so a bottle of wine is too much for one sitting, so I always pour the wine in a smaller glass bottle of about 500ml, then I might split it in 2x200ml and so on. 

Lately it became a burden as you always have to wash the bottle and to store them. Sometimes it's even pointless because you are not sure how much is going to be drunk. Sometimes my wife only wants 100ml and I don't, and I need even smaller bottles to preserve the rest. 

It's a mess and I want to throw all my empty bottles away.

I made some research into plastics, and as we all know the plastic is not really good for preserving stuff, but advancements in plastics have been made, specifically HDPE is a type of plastic that is highly inert and is also used in reusable water bottles. The main advantage here is that they are squishable so I never have to pour it in another bottle when I need just a little wine.

But most of the bottles that I find for sale don't look nice to keep wine inside. Maybe someone can suggest a specific brand.

Decanted off the sediment and poured a taste right away. Holy shit if it wasnâ€™t still very much intact but downright ALIVE from the first sip. 38+ years later and this thing STILL had fruit. It was mostly tertiary, yes, but the fruit that was there was still identifiable. 

Currant, dried berries and touch of persimmon. Leather, tobacco and a toasty earthiness. The tannin had softened to the point of a fine grit sandpaper, but still added a noticeable mouthfeel and body. Med+ body and long finish. 

I canâ€™t even explain how much this thing changed over the evening. With every sip, every glass, it continued to evolve as if it were doing summersaults. Sometimes the tertiary dominated. Sometimes the fruit popped forward. It was crazy but always in balance.

- 2021 RaventÃ³s i Blanc ""Blanc de Blancs"" [Catalunya]: ""Not-technically-Cava"" that tastes like Champagne. High acid, maybe a bit bready/yeasty, refreshing, and with a lot of pleasant bubbles.

- 2019 Ossian ""Quintaluna"" Verdejo [Segovia]: Sweet-ish, tropical fruits, round and soft on the palate. Made from 100+ year old, pre-phylloxera vines with a bit of oak.

- 2021 Leirana ""Finca Genoveva"" AlbariÃ±o [Rias Baixas]: Very high acid, fruity (lemon-lime). Sharp, with a bit of sea salt in the finish. Vines planted in 1862.

- 2021 Emilio Moro ""El Zarzal"" Godello [Bierzo]: Yellow fruits and high acid, but less than the AlbariÃ±o. Rich and hints of sweetness. Aged on lees and in French oak.

- 2012 R. LÃ³pez de Heredia ""ViÃ±a Tondonia"" Reserva - [Rioja]: Leather, baking spice, coconut, hints of herbs, and tons of red fruits (strawberry) that have been lightly cooked or macerated. Oaky, medium and round tannins.

- 2019 Bodegas AliÃ³n [Ribera del Duero]: Lots of oak, high tannins that are less fine than the previous wine. Stewed dark fruits, some baking spices sprinkled in.

I recently went on a trip to Tuscany Italy, and I was never really a wine drinker. There however, I saw myself faced with some nice local wines and I was a little bit sad, because I couldn't tell in what way these wines were special or characteristic. Thats when I did some google searching on wine tasting and the next dinner I prepared the wines ""profile?"" (sweetness, acidity, tannin,alcohol, body) and we all took turns guessing these characteristics. That was surprisingly fun and now back home (germany) I want to prepare a little wine tasting session. We are all STEM graduates and like experimentation, which is why my initial idea was to gather some wines that are in one way a little more ""on the far end"". Like one very sweet wine, one very sour wine, maybe one wine with less tannins and one with more... I hope you get the idea. So that in the end we might understand a little what the differences between wines are. Now to the obvious question, What wines would you recommend that are more on one end of a spectrum?

15xg38q,beer,"Official /r/beer FAQ - Please Check Here Before Posting **THIS IS NOT INTENDED AS A BEER FAQ.  IT IS ADDRESSING A FEW FREQUENTLY BROUGHT UP TOPICS ON /R/BEER.**

Hi there,

There has been some need for announcements on a few different commonly posted topics.  Since we are limited to two stickied posts, I'm going to use this one as a hub for these issues.  I will be adding to this post as needed, but here's a /r/Beer FAQ to cover these post types.

If you notice people posting these topics, please be polite.  Feel free to link to this post or use the provided links in a response.

This is not an invitation to harass anyone for posting a repeated topic.  Reddit does not do a good job with presenting subreddit announcements, rules, sidebar info, etc.  If posts annoy you and you don't think they belong, please consider downvoting, using a report, sending us a modmail message, hiding the post or simply moving on with your day.  I highly suggest using the ""don't show me submissions after I've downvoted them"" option in old.reddit preferences (this may be broken in the app/resdesign website, but it should be fixed eventually and appear in those preferences as well).

* [How do I ask /r/beer for a beer suggestion?](https://old.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/i0we2n/beer_suggestions_on_rbeer_and_you_so_you_want_to/)
   * Where are you?  What's your general location?   In order to suggest a beer that you should buy, we have to know what beers are available for you to buy.  
   * What do you already drink and like or dislike?  What kinds of flavors are you looking for?
   * What's your budget?   
* [Is this beer safe to drink?  Has it gone bad from age or storage conditions?](https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/zrbeqo/stop_asking_if_your_old_beer_is_ok_to_drink/)
   * Generally speaking, beer does not go bad in a way that will make it dangerous to drink.  This assumes that the beer is stored in a sealed container.  It may taste bad, though
* [Am I drinking too much?  Am I having an allergic reaction to beer or is it otherwise making me sick in some way?](https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/about/rules/)
   * This is covered by the /r/Beer rules (some exceptions may be allowed for more casual or general questions):

>Medical questions will be limited. [/r/Beer](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beer) is the wrong forum for serious medical questions, particularly where there's potential for harm to come as a result of the discussion. Please consult a medical professional for any questions about your own health, not an online beer discussion board.

* [Is Sam Adams Utopias worth the price?](https://old.reddit.com/r/beer/search/?q=utopias&include_over_18=on&restrict_sr=on&t=all&sort=new)  
  * That's ultimately up to you, but please look through the many past posts on the topic.

&#x200B;

I'm trying to hit the more pressing topics first, but I'll look for some good links for other topics (""how do I figure out what kind of beers I like?"", ""what are the best budget beers?"", etc.).

Everyone is welcome to [join the official /r/Beer Discord server](https://discord.gg/MvMVFA4Vu3) if you'd like to discuss anything here or just hang out and chat.

Cheers.

Edit: I'm locking this to comments because I don't want to have the post turn into a place where people ask these questions.  However, feel free to post about any topics or send us suggestions for topics to be added via modmail or Discord chat.

Also, I may use the second announcement slot for a specific post on something like old beer questions, but I'd prefer to keep it open for the weekly No Stupid Questions posts (and possibly others; still working on redoing the scheduled posts and making some better topics).",0.125,0.784,0.091,-0.9738,negative,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I regularly drink between one and two 40 oz Steel Reserves in a night (I know people think itâ€™s nasty but I genuinely like it), and volume wise, thatâ€™s the equivalent of 4-7 beers.

I distinctly remember once drinking a beer called â€œNottinghamâ€ by Kehrwieder Kreativbrauerei from Hamburg â€“ while it definitely did not taste the same as wine, for someone who has never drunk any wine I would say it could be an okay approximation in a more interesting way than drinking, say, single-grape juice.
So my question to you: Did you lot ever have a barleywine that tasted a little bit/as close as possible to actual (red) wine? I would buy a Nottingham, but they do not seem to make it anymore. I am situated in Northern Germany, but for this special friend and project I would be ready to import a beer from anywhere.
Thanks a lot for your answers!",0.0,0.821,0.179,0.9814,not_negative,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

For whatever reason they have the reputation of being an Australian beer when they're actually English I think. I like they because of the bulky size of their single cans, their good reliable malty tasty which I enjoyed many times while munching on countless Japanese style peanuts, and finally because I have a core memory associated with the beer.

I was during one of my college Summers my Dad flew me out to his apartment in Newcastle for an internship. It was an exciting time, but I was depressed in college and my parent's relationships were at a nadir, I wouldn't know it at the time but they'd eventually divorce.

Case in point it was a sad time in my life. When I finally reached his apartment I was so tired, a heavy, sleep deprived body tiredness. My Dad bought me the beer and brought me some wasabi flavored Japanese peanuts from Switzerland. They tasted amazing and the beer really helped me relax. I remember just sitting in his living room couch enjoying my ""dinner"" just before a nice warm shower. I wasn't watching anything on TV, just catching up with Dad.

My fiancÃ© and his dad used to get a growler and beer for a long time neighbor every Halloween but his dad passed away earlier this year. We donâ€™t know the kind of beer his dad used to buy but we wanted to uphold the old tradition. 

We could ask, but we kind of want it to be a surprise since the tradition kind of fazed out after my father in law moved away and leaving us the house to live in. Also, itâ€™s become a little more rare seeing our neighbor outside and striking up a convo.

So of course this is purely subjective and can be a hit or miss, but Iâ€™m curious, what kind of beer would you suggest for a 70+ Midwestern man?

I feel like Iâ€™m easing into my â€œCarlsbergâ€ years. I just want to stock my fridge with a 24 and not overthink it. Iâ€™m ready for a house beer.

The problem is, despite all the craft breweries around, Iâ€™m finding it hard to nail one down that fits my criteria, so Iâ€™m hoping for some help.

Hereâ€™s what I am looking for:
-available in 355cans or even better 341bottles.
-ideally available in bulk and not TOO expensive though that is relative and am willing to pay if needed
-ideally craft beer but Iâ€™m starting to think none will fit this bill so open to â€˜gaspâ€™ macro
-5%abv or less
-available in Ontario - and delivery across Ontario as Iâ€™m in Kingston

So far, Iâ€™ve tried
-Muskoka detour (not as good as it used to be. I had high hopes for this one but nope)
-lug lite (not off the table but not great)
-Muskoka tread lightly (loathed it)
-miller high life (sad to this this one is currently in the lead :()
-miller lite (tied with high life)
-side launch light lager (this one isnâ€™t bad)
-Modelo especial (donâ€™t like the beer but has a little skunk that is nostalgic which I kinda did)
-blood brothers blood light (this is my top beer from the category but get expensive since they donâ€™t sell by the case and need to pay shipping)
-Carlsberg (didnâ€™t try because you canâ€™t get in bottles anywhere around here)


On a side note: I LOATHE that every craft brewery is doing tall boys right now. IMHO if youâ€™re doing a light beer and putting it in tall boys youâ€™re doing it wrong. (I assume this was LCBOâ€™s doing so reckon they deserve the blame).

1g1ohus,beer,"What would it take for British style ales (Bitters, Milds, and Pales) to become popular in the US again? The beer that really kickstarted my love of beer was Fuller's ESB. Before I had that when I was 21, I really only drank craft beers because they were stronger and could give you a good buzz faster (Victory Golden Monkey, Lagunitas Brown Shugga, Weyerbacher Merry Monks, etc). But I started reading around and trying new beers and styles for the fun of it, not just to get drunk. I'll always remember having Fuller's ESB for the first time. I was so amazed by the whole experience of how complex the malts were, how much I loved the fruity esters, and how the herbal hops used really balanced it all out. This was in around 2018-ish, and unfortunately since then so many English ales aren't available anymore. Fuller's ESB is gone. Hobgoblin ruby isn't available near me anymore. The more mass produced examples (which weren't really as good anyway) have also disappeared (red hook ESB, honker's ale etc).   


Last April I had the privelidge of going to NERAX (New England Real Ale Exhibiton) and got to try so many cask ales from the UK and US. I'm 27, but I felt like a baby there with the average age probably being in the mid-to-late 40s. It was fascinating to learn how influential British beer styles and brewing culture were to the early craft beer movement in the US. Now, coming upon a British style at a store or a brewery is extemely uncommon. 

  
My question is this. Right now in the US, lagers are making a huge comeback as people are looking for something drinkable and lower ABV that is sessionable. Why aren't British styles a part of this resurgence? They are often even lower in ABV than many lager styles, and are often much more complex and interesting. From an economic standpoint, I believe they are also cheaper to brew as they do not require extended storage. What gives? What's stopping these amazing styles from becoming more of a staple in the craft beer scene in the US?",0.041,0.819,0.14,0.9917,not_negative,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Picture this. Ontario. 1988.

Iâ€™m a 9 year old boy. My dad leaves the room, and I take a sip of his beer. Itâ€™s gross. I hate it. But the taste makes an imprint.

Skunky. A bit vegetal.

I grew up, got into craft beer. IPAs, DIPAs, Imperial Stouts, sours.

All great - but Iâ€™ve still yet to taste that taste that I remember.

The closest was a Pacifico on vacation once. But I canâ€™t get that in Ontario.

The only clue I have is that I know my dad drank Oâ€™keefe at one point. But I canâ€™t get that here.

I imagine itâ€™s a taste found in macro beer? Iâ€™ve tried a couple with no luck. I tried Miller Lite and it had a hint of it in the first sip but then it disappeared.

So, I guess Iâ€™m wondering, what beers should I try that might have that nostalgic, skunky, mildly vegetal 80s dad beer taste?

The team at Burial Brewing in Asheville has been feeding the community and directing folks to fundraisers as they recover from the catastrophic flooding of Hurricane Helene (I know others like DSSOLVR are helping, but they're who I follow on Instagram). I emailed them to see if I could donate to them to help them with their efforts, and [as promised](https://old.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1fu4fei/asheville_breweries_devastated_by_helene_flooding/lq2fzz1/), here's the email I received:

---

Good Morning Folks,

I want to start by saying thank you to each of you who reached out to offer support. Itâ€™s been overwhelming to keep up with in the best possible way. Hearing from you is keeping us optimistic and moving forward. Iâ€™d also like to thank you for your patience as we tried to wrap our heads around where and how to direct these offers.

Weâ€™ve spent the past few days sorting through the abundance of information thatâ€™s out there and have settled on the following as a start.

**For those looking to support Asheville and WNC:**

**For those looking to support Burial Beer Co.:**

* **Overview** - As of Tuesday, October 1st, we have been in contact with 100% of Burial's Asheville Staff. Everyone is safe and accounted for. We're considering ourselves incredibly lucky that our Asheville locations did not sustain any major damage. Unfortunately, many of our friends and neighbors cannot say the same. Our timeline on reopening any Burial AVL locations will largely rely on the city's ability to re-establish a potable and running water supply, which we've heard may take weeks and up to months. That being said, our main focus right now is supplying hot meals, cold water, dry goods, feminine products, gas, and electricity to both our staff and the community.
* **Physical Donations** -
Both our Charlotte and Raleigh Taprooms are accepting donations that will be delivered to our South Slope Asheville Taproom. Additionally, UPS and FedEx have resumed service to Asheville. If you're interested and able to send dry goods, feminine products, or bottled water, our address is:
  * [40 Collier Ave, Asheville, NC 28801](https://www.google.com/maps/search/40+Collier+Ave,+Asheville,+NC+28801?entry=gmail&source=g)
* **Volunteering** -
We are thankful to have the resources on our staff to handle our limited Asheville operations at the moment. For those of you looking to volunteer, we'd like to direct you to: volunteer@buncombecounty.org.
* **Financial Support** -
  * [GoFundMe for Asheville Hospitality Staff](https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-asheville-coworkers-in-recovery-together) - Our Charlotte Taproom Manager, Alissa Gavin, has created a fund that will benefit our AVL Bartenders and Kitchen Employees currently unable to work. 
  * [Charlotte](https://burialbeer.com/pages/charlotte-house-of-relics) & [Raleigh](https://burialbeer.com/pages/raleigh-the-exhibit) Taprooms - Both locations are currently open with standard operations. Come say hi to our teams, enjoy some pours, and take some beer to-go.
  * [Online Shop](https://burialbeer.com/pages/delivery-asheville-pickup) - Our Online Shop for Beer and Merchandise Shipping is active. We're working to catch up on orders received during the storm, as well as the new orders coming in each day. Shipping will likely be a bit slower than you're used to from us, but we will get you the goods as soon as we possibly can.
I know this is a lot, but please let me know if you have any questions. I will do my best to get back to everyone as quickly as possible.

1fv2ccb,beer,"ColdFire Brewingâ€™s â€œFlavor Policeâ€ â€“ A Rant About Customer Choice and Brewery Elitism Iâ€™ve got to say, Iâ€™ve had some great times at ColdFire Brewing Company in Eugene, Oregon. They make solid beer, and Iâ€™ve enjoyed supporting a local spot. But tonight? They really lost me with one of the most pretentious policies Iâ€™ve ever come across in any brewery.

Iâ€™ve been to breweries all over the country and made the same simple request at all of them: half IPA, half cider. I like the sweetness of the cider mixed with the hoppiness of the IPAâ€”itâ€™s a combo that works for me. But apparently, ColdFire doesnâ€™t care what its customers like. When I ordered this, the server told me itâ€™s company policy not to honor requests like this because (Iâ€™m paraphrasing here), the brewers work â€œreally hardâ€ to create flavor profiles, and customers need to â€œhonor that.â€ Yeah, really.

What? I thought I walked into a brewery, not the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld. â€œNo mixed drinks for you!â€ I made that exact comparison to the server, who looked at me like Iâ€™d just insulted their entire family. Seriously, though, the snobby disdain in the response was just off-putting.

And hereâ€™s the thing: Iâ€™ve never had a pub, bar, or brewery deny this simple request, which Iâ€™ve made dozens of times over many years at all kinds of places. But ColdFire? Theyâ€™re so wrapped up in their self-importance that they actually enforce this ridiculous policy, as if theyâ€™re doing us a favor by refusing what we like.

And letâ€™s get one thing straightâ€”denying a customerâ€™s requestâ€”even if it seems a bit weirdâ€”should NEVER be a company policy at a food and beverage establishment or anywhere in the service industry. The customerâ€™s preferences reign supreme, especially over the pride and ego of the chefs or, in this case, the brewers. Customers come to enjoy themselves, not be told their tastes are wrong.

FOOD AND DRINK IS PERSONAL. What tastes good to one person might taste like absolute trash to another. People alter their food and drinks to suit their own tastes all the time. Imagine a steakhouse refusing to give you salt because â€œthe chef seasoned it to perfection,â€ or an ice cream shop rejecting your request for two different flavors because â€œour chef determined those donâ€™t go together.â€ Itâ€™s absurd, right? But here we are.

ColdFire, youâ€™ve officially become one of the most pretentious and out-of-touch establishments in Eugene. Congratulations. Newsflash: customers come to enjoy themselves, not to bow down to some snobby, self-important idea of what â€œshouldâ€ be good. And the fact that Iâ€™ve never had a single other place deny this request? That just makes your policy all the more ridiculous.

So, has anyone else had this experience? Is this really the hill ColdFire wants to die on? Curious to hear if this is a one-off or if other people have noticed a shift in the customer experience here. Also curious if anyone knows the name of the owner(s).",0.104,0.75,0.146,0.974,not_negative,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

1fsucz5,beer,"Using a c-DGM Gehaltemeter for RTD Hello Hello, I have a question slightly outside the beer topic, but I know some breweries also produce RTD beverages. The other day, we were canning Cuba Libre, and something happened with the carbonation. Everything was measured using a c-DGM Gehaltemeter Haffmans CO2/O2, calibrated and clean:

* Carbonation in the BBT: 2.71 vol.
* Carbonation inline, at the filler inlet: 2.70 vol.
* Carbonation in the cans (average of 35 cans): 2.14 vol.

The cans were randomly selected from the packaging line and refrigerated until they reached an approximate temperature of 32-33 Â°F.

My question is the following: during the measurement, if I didnâ€™t fully open the flow on the equipment, the temperature didnâ€™t drop enough, showing a higher reading (the liquid was about 33 Â°F, but the equipment read 37 Â°F). For this type of product, where Iâ€™m only measuring CO2, what is the correct procedure? (I've never got this kind of problems with the beer, so, im asking for RTD).  Should I fully open the flow until the measurement stabilizes? If so, why does the pressure drop so much, and consequently the carbonation, when there was no breakout or foaming during filling?

Additionally, could it be that the CO2 loss is happening during filling and not due to incorrect measurement? Since this beverage has no proteins (unlike beer, which does allow CO2 retention), would it be advisable to add some additive to improve foam retention in the liquid?

I'm a Belgian visiting London soon, so I'm looking for some beer recommendations.

I've been doing some research online, and it has lead me to things like milk stout, oatmeal stout, tropical stout and honey beer. I have to admit that I've ignored stout beers due to disliking Guinness. But apparently that's an imperial stout? The guesthouse I'm staying at is above an Irish pub, so I'm assuming they'll have quite a few stouts for me to try.

I have a work trip to the Boston / Cambridge area in a few weeks and Iâ€™m looking for some recommendations on where to check out. Iâ€™ll have at least one evening to myself to stop at a place or 2 and get some food. 

Iâ€™ll be staying at the Double Tree Suites Boston - Cambridge and plan on ubering between spots or walking if the place is right.

I mainly enjoy lagers and west coast style ales. Iâ€™ve had plenty of Trillium beers, so I probably will be skipping them. On a previous trip to the area many moons ago, Iâ€™ve checked out Night Shift, Cambridge Brewing, Harpoon, & Sam Adams. Looking to visit a local spot, preferably with food also.

Thanks in advance for any recommendations.

1fpclcz,beer,"The nun Hildegard and the hops beer  A beer in the Middle Ages did not have the same flavor as today, as they lacked hops. After the 16th century, beers began to regularly include this ingredient. For years, only a mixture of herbs and spices was used to slightly alter its flavor, around the 1100s AD.

The nun **Hildegard von Bingen** (1098-1179), in a German monastery, wrote a treatise on the benefits of hops, beer, and the use of hops in it. Based on the fact that sweet drinks were heavily consumed, which led to vision problems and blindness, Hildegard suggested that the bitterness of beer counteracted the overconsumption of such beverages.

Thanks to Hildegard, hops were identified as growing in the chapel of Bavaria and became recognized as a key ingredient in beer. It wasnâ€™t until 1400 that hops reached the Netherlands, and in 1519 it was condemned as a bad herb. Not until the 16th century was it included as a basic ingredient.",0.068,0.854,0.078,-0.0516,negative,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Guinness Extra Stout. Itâ€™s %0.4 weaker than the Irish version. It lacks body, flavor, and is fizzy as if thereâ€™s zero nitro in it. Nitro or not itâ€™s just way more fizzy and empty tasting.

Grolsch. Honestly itâ€™s been awhile since I drank an original. But this is flabby and barely palatable. It should be a little more hop sharp and slightly sea sprayâ€™esque.

The problem here is if youâ€™ve never experienced the originals you either like the under contract versions for what they are or you donâ€™t. And I think that Molson and maybe a little less so Labatt, have always wanted to homogenize and lower the expectations of the beer drinking experience.

Or perhaps this is a result of their vertical integration of procuring grains and hops, combined with their standardized brewing process.

While I usually drink to forget about the oncoming doom that is climate change, I've actually started to research some of the most sustainable brewers fighting the good fight. I've listed a few I found below: 

- New Belgium Brewing (Colorado, USA):Â This brewery is a pioneer in the sustainable beer movement. They run on 100% wind power, have an impressive water conservation system, and even use a methane-powered co-gen engine to turn waste into energy. Plus, they're a certified B Corporation, which is always good!

- Camden Town Brewery (Camden Town, London):Â Despite supporting the worst team in North London, Camden Town Brewery is dedicated to sustainability, using 100% renewable electricity, recycling brewing waste, and minimising material use in packaging. They also conserve water and collaborate with local farmers and a UK charity to reduce environmental impact.

- Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. (California, USA):Â Known for their zero-waste initiative, Sierra Nevada recycles or reuses nearly 100% of their waste. They've also invested heavily in solar energy and have one of the largest privately-owned solar arrays in the U.S. Their commitment to water conservation and sustainable agriculture is also top-notch.

- To Ã˜l (Copenhagen, Denmark):Â To Ã˜l operates out of a facility they've dubbed ""To Ã˜l City,"" which is all about zero-waste and circular economy principles. They're using local, organic ingredients and innovative packaging solutions that make their operations as sustainable as possible.

I am in Saigon Vietnam now and grabbed a few Asahis at 7-11 but the moment I took a sip from the first one, I knew something was off.  Not only did it not taste the same, but I have never tasted a beer that tasted like some sort of chemical in my entire life.  It was very pronounced.  I cracked open another one and same thing.  I asked my wife to take a sip and she immediately agreed something is way off.  I then inspected the can and it said this on the side. 

â€œby Shenzhen Tsingtao Beer
Asahi Breweries, Ltd., Tokyoâ€
www.asahisuperdry.com

I assumed it was from Japan, but I guess it is a Chinese brewed one, but why so different and why such an awful chemical taste?  Surely Asahi has quality control?  What could have caused this?  Left in the hot sun?  Did I drink a fake beer?   Has anyone had this experience with other beers?  

Also, unsure if related, but about an hour after having those sips (maybe 2 oz/60ml total) my toes on both my feet suddenly curled up with the most intense cramp I have ever experienced and it took 30 mins of massage and hot water to calm them down. I rarely get cramped toes and never for more than a second or two on one foot so this was a big surprise.  So much so that it has me wondering if that beer was poison in some way?  I looked into causes of extreme toe cramps and the only possible thing that jumped out was poisoning as there was no other cause that rang as even possible.

All there was was bottled beers (or canned) which You'd get at shops, and they were just... what I'd call Â« regular Â» beers. No hops.

But then all of a sudden (well, if You can call a decade or couple of decades as Â« sudden Â»), suddenly hops everywhere. And specialty beers, and bars that make their special beers, etc. And it seems to Me that this happened quite all over the world. Again : IPAs, APAs, ales, hops and hops.

1fgr3vn,beer,"CO2/Keg advice Hello. I am having a problem with my new keg setup and Iâ€™m having trouble finding anyone with a similar issue online. 

I got this set up a month ago. Two sixel kegs in a kegerator hooked up to two taps. I have attached a 5 lb CO2 tank to the kegs. 

For the first week it ran no problems. The pours were foamy but after fiddling with the pressure levels I got it pouring well. Then the CO2 tank ran out with both kegs still about half full. I rubbed soap on all the points of escape and found a leak, applied sealant to it and it stopped leaking there. Hooked up a new tank and it poured well, but less than a week later, same problem. The kegs were empty now, replaced them, hooked up a new tank and couldnâ€™t find another leak. 

This is the part where Iâ€™m not finding anyone with the same issue. I followed some instructions I found online:

1. pressurize the regulator until the low pressure gauge is reading 10 psi

2. close the valve between the regulator and the hose and shut off the tank 

The instructions said the pressure should stay the same. What happened was they stayed the same for two minutes, then quickly increased to 25 psi, before suddenly dropping to zero. I tried this twice and the same thing happened each time. 

This is a full tank of CO2 and when I set everything up normally it is pouring beer out of both taps no issue, but I am confused about why my tanks are going empty so fast. 

Has anyone had an issue like this before? Iâ€™m thinking I may need to replace the regulator? Iâ€™m not sure what other troubleshooting to do and I want advice from people more experienced than me before I spend more money on this thing.

My wedding is a month away and I'm getting two 1/2 barrel kegs for the event. 

I've never gotten kegs before so I don't really know what size container for ice I need to keep them cold the day of the event. 

I planned on getting some cheap insulated jackets for them and I want to get two containers I can set them in and fill will ice. They'll be inside the venue for the reception. I will probably pick them up late that morning (maybe like 1030 or 11), load them in my truck and drive up to the venue spot about 20 minutes from me, unload them then head out to get some ice. The wedding start time is 5pm. 

I see a keg is about 16"" diameter and I'm seeing containers that are a 17.5"" width. Do I need something wider? Taller? What would you recommend?

I'm looking for advice...

I am looking to add 6 new draught keg beer lines to my licensed premesis which I own freehold. Currently there is no celllar and I have no taps.

I have all planning and licensing in order for a new cellar area and 6 lines, the cellar being behind the current bar (under 5 meters from keg to tap in a straight line) I am very capable doing any building out work, drilling walls for trunking, connecting things up ect.

However my knowledge of how to design this system is limited to speaking with equipment suppliers and reading/watching websites/YouTube.

At the moment Im thinking I could have a stab at creating this system, buying and installing the parts myself. However I'm concerned I may hit pitfalls or poorly design it. 

I will not be doing the phyiaical cellar room build or the electrics/cellar cooling myself. I am only considering creating the keg draught system.

Is there any good information/resources/recommend training you can share given the above.

If I'm way off the mark and I'm crazy to even attempt it, please let me know aswell.

Thank you.

1fammom,beer,"PSA for Guinness drinkers: Guinness seems to keep extending their $5 rebate program I've been using this for maybe a year or so now. While it used to be seasonal.... it seems they're currently keeping this going indefinitely as it's now been extended until the end of the year. To me, Guinness is a great session beer that is widely available, but my main complaint has always been that it's just a touch too expensive for what it is. This rebate knocks it down to the $1 per 12oz territory (if you're buying the nitro 8 packs), which is pretty great (it's about $15-16 at my grocery store).

I buy Guinness semi-regularly so I've been taking full advantage. The money is typically venmoed to you in a few days.  I think there's a limit of 4 uses per month per person.

Second, what cities and breweries would you recommend visiting? This [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/s83g8a/beer_pilgrimage_with_my_dad_to_germany_belgium/) had some great answers, but it's two years old and so I thought maybe there may some more newer answers.

For various reasons I don't drink beer regularly, but when I do I almost always turn to Unibroue.

I contacted Unibroue and they told me that now they will only be distributing La Fin Du Monde and Blanche De Chambley in the US. That is quite a blow!

1. Is there any gold standard site/online store front where I can buy this in from Canada and have it shipped to the US? I keep seeing various info about trying to ship on your own, etc., but I just want to know if there is a site known for doing this.

For the unaware, there are two styles of German Oktoberfest bier. In America, we generally only see the older style called MÃ¤rzen, which is an amber very malty style that was traditionally aged half a year (hence the name. Most is not aged nowadays and the flavor is achieved via other means though some still age theirs). 

The more modern variant is known as festbier and is somewhere in between a MÃ¤rzen and a standard helles lager. Malty, slightly hoppy, easy drinking with a surprising kick of alcohol.

I tend to enjoy beers that are on the bitter and â€œaggressiveâ€ sideâ€”if that makes sense. For example, Iâ€™m a fan of Steel Reserve. Iâ€™m looking for something new to try that fits this flavor profile. Any recommendations? Help me out here!

1exes97,beer,"Best Hefeweizens? What do you think are the best Hefeweizens? 

I never really got into beer until I visited Munich in 2015. Since then, Hefeweizens have been my go to beers. I've tried several, and here is my take.

Weihenstephan - this is the one where I notice variations from batch to batch, so it's a bit or miss for me. I've noticed that some have a stronger note of clove, and I really don't like them. The ones I've gotten that had strong banana note, I think are the best I've had. But again, it's inconsistent in my opinion, so it's not my go to.

KÃ¶nig Ludwig Weissbier- it's been a few years since I've had it, so I can't really comment on specifics, but I know that it's probably almost my favorite or at least top 3

Franziskaner- I don't think it's quite as good as the  best weihenstephans or Ludwig's ive had, but it's very consistent, and (at least for me) easy to find. I'd describe this one as a more bready taste.

I had some of the Hofbrau Hefeweizen last week, it was pretty good, but seemed a bit more bitter than other Hefeweizens.

Ive probably tried the Hefeweizens from most or all of the Munich breweries, but none of them were memorable enough for me to comment on or good enough for me to have continue purchasing.

I was in the mood for an IPA tonight and I wanted to try something new without driving to a brewery, so I went to my local liquor store and ended up with this 6 pack of Goose Island. Got home to put it in the fridge and noticed the date printed on it was two months out. I know some breweries will print a can date vs an expiration date, but after a quick search apparently Goose Island prints expiration dates. So I went back to the store and showed them the date on the box, and they told me I was wrong and that was the can date, and the expiration date was the one next to it. The serial code. If that were the case it would have expired on December 9th, 2002 even though it was canned on June 24th, 2024. Apparently they think beer retro-expires and they wouldnâ€™t have it, and not wanting to start an argument, I just took it and left. Even if it was December 2024, I would think hop character would significantly degrade in that amount of time. Obviously 5 or 6 month old (from the actual can date) beer wonâ€™t hurt you, but Iâ€™m a little salty they sold me a likely stale 6 pack. Oh well, itâ€™s 7% so itâ€™ll still get me buzzed lmao.

Just with a quick google search, [Guinness Nitrosurge | Official Global Site](https://nitrosurge.guinness.com/en/), seems to have a device for specialty beer cans. However, you have to use special cans that are not sold in the US. IMO their US canned beer is nothing like what you get in Ireland, so if this works it would be revolutionary.

Then there are also the machines (like [Amazon.com : Chill-O-Matic Instant Beverage Cooler.

3 days ago I got that email. Without thinking I jumped at the opportunity and forked out $117.30 for a case of 24 tallboys. I watched the tracking like a hawk, excited for the day it would arrive. That day was today!

Iâ€™m sitting here in Melbourne (Australia ) enjoying a few Miller Lite. 

This is a special occasion for us as this beer is not available here. A mate brought it over after a trip to the USA. We rarely have access to it.

Itâ€™s a special beer for us because we had an absolutely phenomenal week in Las Vegas to celebrate turning forty (eight years ago now). Many miller lite were drunk during that trip. 

Iâ€™ve been told by one of our mates that Miller Lite is considered a â€œredneck beerâ€ in the US. In fact when he was sitting on the verandah enjoying a miller lite in his last trip to the US (Washington) with his family there he was told â€œall we need is a pickup truck and a confederate flagâ€

Trying so many similarly tasting beers in one night is *very* mentally exhausting, not to mention the exhaustion of excessive drinking. Yet, at the very end, the #1 beer was unanimously decided, and everyone's top 5 was pretty damn close. For the 4 months after the tasting, I drank several more of each to fine tune my ratings and comments. I drank them grouped by brewery, I've drank them worst to best, and I've done more side-by-sides than I can count. I questioned why I was laboring so hard over this pointless ranking... but I had to keep on going.
   
Perhaps the most eye-opening part of all this was how profoundly shitty it made me feel. The hangover made me feel so remarkably disgusting, considerably more so than craft beer ever has, and in a qualitatively different way. I'm thinking it's the dog food grade ingredients used in these shitty lagers. I hope to never feel that way again.

Anyways... on to the ranking!

#[The Killshot](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/3e3a9798fba856c2c497652d7fba5b77_c_1351703492_raw.jpeg)
    
1. [High Life](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/6a19a589b975bfbd571abcf0e4e26d0b_c_1351728906_raw.jpeg) - 4/5 - The champagne of beers is unanimous winner of the 33 shit lager showdown. Wonderfully balanced, flavorful, and clean maltiness with a well balanced hop note. This truly sets the standard for American macro lager.

2. [Pabst Blue Ribbon Extra](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/6fe817048ac162db1a589cc8fea60438_c_1351727722_raw.jpeg) - 4/5 - I am surprised by how good this is compared to regular PBR. It's bolder but tastes like better quality ingredients too. There's a bit of a spicy earthy toasty hop thing, and a more substantial maltiness and body. Great stuff! It's also the only mass market lager I found packaged using the plastic PakTech can carriers.

3. [Coors Banquet](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/7b4e5174d56b143c9a2a136b842f2154_c_1351726697_raw.jpeg) - 4/5 - Easily top 3 American shit lagers. Super clean crispy malts, light balanced hops, a touch of sweetness, and an almost creamy carbonation profile. It just tastes good.

4. [Hamms](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/86fd4815d92ac6ccbc29b16e065f688e_c_1351726314_raw.jpeg) - 3.75/5 - Surprised myself with how much I like this one. Superbly clean and crispy, maybe a touch sweeter than others but tastes great. I miss the Hamms Instagram account

5. [Rolling Rock](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/c1860d79e0d1f99e897db03ecf35c8f3_c_1351725860_raw.jpeg) - 3.75/5 - Crispy, super clean malt, melon rind hop, with great balance. It's delightfully simple and infinitely crushable. Very well executed.

6. [Bud Ice](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/8db71c26e5166caad86c66f9fef24def_c_1351724203_raw.jpeg) - 3.75/5 - I love this label, makes me think of 90s-era ice hockey. Tastes surprisingly good. It's definitely stronger but it's not offensively bold like most other ice beers. Maybe a little more prominent wood flavor smoothing things out aside the crispy clean maltiness. Huge spread across the rankings from Budweiser!

7. [Budweiser](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/19b841c856338a6a0e43a46d129547f2_c_1351723555_raw.jpeg) - 3.5/5 - My late grandfather's beer of choice, because everything else gives you brain cancer. I like it too. Beechwood gives the clean crushable maltiness a smooth woody flavor that I probably wouldn't notice if I wasn't overanalyzing it.

8. [Old Style](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/f8ff28505fa3c2022b602fe45107f3e0_c_1351723127_raw.jpeg) - 3.5/5 - Chicago's favorite. It's maybe a little sweeter than most of the others but brings good body, a deliciously clean maltiness, and a light earthy hop.

9. [Strohs](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/83d58fdfa1969a792c00babda389da78_c_1351722825_raw.jpeg) - 3.5/5 - Formerly brewed in Detroit. Super clean maltiness with a well balanced melony lychee hop thing going on. My dad loves to tell me about his relatives who could drink on the job at the Stroh's factory (but not too much!). Anotehr fun fact - Stroh's spelled backwards is Short's!

10. [Altes](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/52c355dfa1f510a713c81e939fc8421b_c_1351722035_raw.jpeg) - 3.5/5 - Earthy bitter hops and piney sweetness atop a toasted caramel malty base and a crushable body. Maybe crystal malt? Nice hoppy amber vibes. Probably doesn't fit the category all that well, but I'm glad I've tried this Detroit classic.

11. [Michelob Ultra Pure Gold](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/45503b76bfc1b25eecb452b0cfc7fcd3_c_1351721320_raw.jpeg) - 3.5/5 - Better flavor than regular Ultra. Nice clean crispy grainy lagery goodness. I'm thinking that going organic must also meant better ingredients.

12. [Michelob Ultra](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/55dc8cbf5f54a8ca2346adf100cce120_c_1351720724_raw.jpeg) - 3.25/5 - Not bad for a light beer! Crispy and clean, maybe a touch of sweet cereal grains. Ultra light flavor overall, but the flavor that is there is surprisingly decent. It also keeps a consistent flavor as it warms up, which is why it ranks so high on my list.

13. [Pabst Blue Ribbon](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/365b6f4a5eaea49f0a78e66d8d88201f_c_1351719655_raw.jpeg) - 3.25/5 - This is pretty much exactly what I think of when I picture the average American shit lager. Crispy and mostly clean with a little toasted malt and earthy hop, but the ingredients taste cheap overall.

14. [Coors Light](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/faee680671cca497c260ac9ade74e9fa_c_1351719275_raw.jpeg) - 3.25/5 - Coors has their carbonation profile down very well. Nice crispiness without the carbonic acid flavor other light beers have. There is a little clean malt flavor but it's pretty light. Tastes very meh when the carbonation dies down.

15. [Miller Genuine Draft](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/95be8f76debcce5f865763df04b6108f_c_1351718587_raw.jpeg) - 3.25/5 - Awesome label. Beer is fine. Less flavorful than High Life. Maybe a little sweeter and a little more artificial tasting. 

16. [Solid Gold](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/b32158e8c3b5fd3ff073397133ea9ead_c_1351718049_raw.jpeg) - 3.25/5 - Sweet grainy aroma. Tastes a lot less artificial than the typical American lager, not to mention more complex, but its slapped right back down by gross corn flavor.

17. [Michelob Original](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/37294c62e0bc80db186f062634451482_c_1351717581_raw.jpeg) - 3.25/5 - I didn't know this still existed! This is the hoppiest of the bunch, but that's not saying much. A light floral and earthy hop atop a clean yet slightly caramelly maltiness.

18. [Natural Ice](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/0ad145fa017717a8adedfd632b79857d_c_1351717051_raw.jpeg) - 3.25/5 - A little bolder than the average shit lager. A little melony hop and a crispy clean malty base. Some cans have hints of doo doo Natty Daddy flavor. Its inconsistent, just like Natty Daddy, but its usually on the better side

19. [Old Milwaukee Light](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/6c2793b263d1662c5be7f0e82fee28c8_c_1351716320_raw.jpeg) - 3.25/5 - Another light beer that tastes very similar to the original, just a little lighter overall. A little drier too. A rare case of the light beer tasting better than the regular!

20. [Old Milwaukee](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/e58d5fc7f541c57cd089651e9ab1cbf9_c_1351715819_raw.jpeg) - 3.25/5 - Somewhat sweet cereal grains, like off brand Lucky Charms, and a clean finish. This is the only beer of this lineup I had to buy in 30 rack form, but I don't think I'll have a problem smashing through it.

21. [Bud Light](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/3d42b5fba88293261a2f9358c3771f4b_c_1351714982_raw.jpeg) - 3/5 - Light and crisp with a nice clean maltiness. A little more carbonic bite. Not much else to it, which I suppose is the point.

22. [Strohs Light](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/4d47f2fb953dad2fd03cfc14e3bd12ee_c_1351714500_raw.jpeg) - 3/5 - Much lighter and less flavorful than the OG. There's a little carbonic astringency to it, but there's still some good flavor of the OG in there. It gets better as carbonation settles.

23. [Miller Light](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/7b9c4e51c0765995b5dafd0ccf2fe11f_c_1351713607_raw.jpeg) - 3/5 - My first beer! I hated it then, but it's tolerable now. Certainly lighter than their other beers but theres some decent clean malty flavors in there.

24. [Natural Light](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/fee828af2a15a1dcc8d5c7d8d49c4f9c_c_1351712910_raw.jpeg) - 3/5 - Nothing spectacular but it's light, crispy, clean, and inoffensive. I didn't hate drinking it. Although, I once drank this warm on an island with a local hermit, and it was pretty enjoyable that day.

25. [Busch](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/79448458d4a36cef2e92ecfaccb804d1_c_1351711316_raw.jpeg) - 3/5 - Crisp and clean, but leaning hard into light beer territory in terms of flavor (or lack thereof) and abv at 4.3%. Getting a little corn coming through also.

26. [Busch Light](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/c00390b8938369196870eb3be956aed5_c_1351710118_raw.jpeg) - 3/5 - Crisp, clean, and a little corny. Tastes virtually the same as regular Busch, but it's also only 0.2% lighter so what's the point? If anything, it's just a little lighter and a little sweeter.

27. [ICEHOUSE](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/5fe379ccf1ca2498cc1914a8d76ab001_c_1351709617_raw.jpeg) - 2.75/5 - It is certainly bolder than most. A mix of potent grains, slightly caramelly with a surprisingly clean and crushable finish.

28. [Bud Select](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/fa5e3e0f41623b672dc523c7d7e944c8_c_1351709027_raw.jpeg) - 2.75/5 - Crisp clean and light. Just tastes of meh super cheap ingredients. This is the only expired beer in the lineup (by 2 months), but I'm not sure it'd be much better if fresher.

29. [Bud Select 55](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/3890426b9eb6a054dd5ba08f4058198b_c_1351708381_raw.jpeg) - 2.5/5 - Astringent carbonic acid, super light, void of flavor except some light and super cheap malt. Why the need for gross 2.4% 55 calorie beer? Just stop drinking!

30. [Natty Daddy](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/f215c04e174ec59b9edf4fee86dd94db_c_1351707639_raw.jpeg) - 2.5/5 - Definitely stronger than your average shit lager. Not great though. Kind of an off brand honey cereal thing with a little boozy heft. Some cans are okay, but some taste downright awful.

31. [Bud Light Platinum](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/c3a3200af4ccc8d526cb055746201f30_c_1351706335_raw.jpeg) - 2.5/5 - Why is a Bud Light variant their stronger than Bud Ice? This is bold in ways that do not taste good. Stronger shittier malt flavor and a heavier body. I can't believe so many people choose to drink this.

32. [Schlitz](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/98ae15d3804cfe7b06685a6ebca93429_c_1351704991_raw.jpeg) - 2.25/5 - Tastes like cheap sweet cereal grains, kind of a shitty caramel thing, and a little bitterness. It's gross.

33. [Bud Light Next](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/62b5e6155d25220a60231152dcd30a15_c_1351704172_raw.jpeg) - 1.5/5 - This is truly awful. Overcarbonated and mostly tastes of carbonic acid with some astringent fruit flavor at the end.

Itâ€™s a bit more costly, 1,30â‚¬ for a can - compared to like a good one (personal opinion) Kozel which costs 0,90 a can- but absolutely worth it.

Itâ€™s the best Pilsner ever, change my mind. I have gone through all Czech or Slovak beers, let it be Kozel, Radegast, Gambrinus etcâ€¦ which are all good, this is in the top 3 for me, coming second to Guiness. Itâ€™s smooth, a bit more watery than a Gambrinus but it has a light body with no aftertaste. It has everything I need in a beer.

The Guinness Pub Pack is sold at a discount beer store currently for about 16 bucks, gets you 15 cans split between normal Guinness, Harp Lager and Smithwick Red.

1gs4wsg,beer,"Pilsner Urquell guy back again ðŸ¤— So we can say, I am just starting to enjoy beer. The taste, the â€œhoppynesâ€ (hope I spelt that right), the bitter aftertaste etcâ€¦.

I drank a lot of it, that for sure. But I have never appreciated good beer. I used to drink beer to get drunk, now I drink it because I enjoy it so much. 

The different experience you get with every different one, tasting the difference between canned, bottled and kegs. Donâ€™t get me wrong, itâ€™s a really nice feeling to get a bit tipsy after work, but that not the goal anymore. 

So, today I went into the local liquor store to get a tap for my Zahringer keg (not in production anymore, but for how cheap it was, man is it good from a keg) that my friend gave me who has a bar at home. 

Anyways, I found a really good deal. For 2,5 litres of bottled Pilsner Urquell and a Pilsner glass (jug? how do you call a beer bottle, English is not my specialty after drinking hahahah) I paid 8 fucking Euros. 8. And itâ€™s a holiday pack to be specific. I could not believe my eyes when seeing the price tag, especially after seeing that an 8 pack goes for 12 euros.

Itâ€™s a wonderful gift for myself ðŸ˜‚ But man, can you taste the difference between canned and bottled. Canned has a lighter body, and goes down realllly smooth. While bottled comes through with that wonderful hoppynes and a bitter aftertaste, while being more foamy and consistent. I am drinking the 3rd bottle with the same joy as I was drinking the first. 

My next step is to get a small keg of this. I mean, if itâ€™s this good from a bottle, how much better could it be unpasteurised from the factory? Come onnn, itâ€™s not fair.

I also bought an Erdinger? Wheat beer, first time drinking one and man, is it good. That light texture, canâ€™t even taste the alcohol and the aftertaste which I canâ€™t describe.
