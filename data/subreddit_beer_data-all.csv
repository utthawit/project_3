Official /r/beer FAQ - Please Check Here Before Posting,22,15xg38q,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/15xg38q/official_rbeer_faq_please_check_here_before/,0,2023-08-22 01:39:54,"**THIS IS NOT INTENDED AS A BEER FAQ.  IT IS ADDRESSING A FEW FREQUENTLY BROUGHT UP TOPICS ON /R/BEER.**

Hi there,

There has been some need for announcements on a few different commonly posted topics.  Since we are limited to two stickied posts, I'm going to use this one as a hub for these issues.  I will be adding to this post as needed, but here's a /r/Beer FAQ to cover these post types.

If you notice people posting these topics, please be polite.  Feel free to link to this post or use the provided links in a response.

This is not an invitation to harass anyone for posting a repeated topic.  Reddit does not do a good job with presenting subreddit announcements, rules, sidebar info, etc.  If posts annoy you and you don't think they belong, please consider downvoting, using a report, sending us a modmail message, hiding the post or simply moving on with your day.  I highly suggest using the ""don't show me submissions after I've downvoted them"" option in old.reddit preferences (this may be broken in the app/resdesign website, but it should be fixed eventually and appear in those preferences as well).

* [How do I ask /r/beer for a beer suggestion?](https://old.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/i0we2n/beer_suggestions_on_rbeer_and_you_so_you_want_to/)
   * Where are you?  What's your general location?   In order to suggest a beer that you should buy, we have to know what beers are available for you to buy.  
   * What do you already drink and like or dislike?  What kinds of flavors are you looking for?
   * What's your budget?   
* [Is this beer safe to drink?  Has it gone bad from age or storage conditions?](https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/zrbeqo/stop_asking_if_your_old_beer_is_ok_to_drink/)
   * Generally speaking, beer does not go bad in a way that will make it dangerous to drink.  This assumes that the beer is stored in a sealed container.  It may taste bad, though
* [Am I drinking too much?  Am I having an allergic reaction to beer or is it otherwise making me sick in some way?](https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/about/rules/)
   * This is covered by the /r/Beer rules (some exceptions may be allowed for more casual or general questions):

>Medical questions will be limited. [/r/Beer](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beer) is the wrong forum for serious medical questions, particularly where there's potential for harm to come as a result of the discussion. Please consult a medical professional for any questions about your own health, not an online beer discussion board.

* [Is Sam Adams Utopias worth the price?](https://old.reddit.com/r/beer/search/?q=utopias&include_over_18=on&restrict_sr=on&t=all&sort=new)  
  * That's ultimately up to you, but please look through the many past posts on the topic.

&#x200B;

I'm trying to hit the more pressing topics first, but I'll look for some good links for other topics (""how do I figure out what kind of beers I like?"", ""what are the best budget beers?"", etc.).

Everyone is welcome to [join the official /r/Beer Discord server](https://discord.gg/MvMVFA4Vu3) if you'd like to discuss anything here or just hang out and chat.

Cheers.

Edit: I'm locking this to comments because I don't want to have the post turn into a place where people ask these questions.  However, feel free to post about any topics or send us suggestions for topics to be added via modmail or Discord chat.

Also, I may use the second announcement slot for a specific post on something like old beer questions, but I'd prefer to keep it open for the weekly No Stupid Questions posts (and possibly others; still working on redoing the scheduled posts and making some better topics)."

How is it physically possible to consume 20-30 beers in a day?,0,1gopw02,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1gopw02/how_is_it_physically_possible_to_consume_2030/,7,2024-11-11 18:15:55,"Iâ€™ve heard many people say they do this or tell me they know someone who does this and I donâ€™t understand how this is even possible. Just the sheer volume of liquid is unbelievable. I regularly drink between one and two 40 oz Steel Reserves in a night (I know people think itâ€™s nasty but I genuinely like it), and volume wise, thatâ€™s the equivalent of 4-7 beers. When I do that, especially if I drink more than just one, the urge to piss never goes away. Even seconds after pissing, I still feel like I need to go. Maybe itâ€™s exaggeration but plenty of people claim to drink four times as much. I donâ€™t know if thatâ€™s spaced out over a whole day or just night. Either way that is an unbelievable amount of liquid. The stomach can only reasonably hold like two liters at a time, and I donâ€™t feel like doing the math, but I imagine that much beer far exceeds two liters, even when spaced out over many hours. How can anyoneâ€™s body hold that without throwing up? "

I understand how tariffs work. I wanted to share my concern with you all. At the same time, I feel like, though I may be misguided, that beer community has a lot of people who voted for Trump. You know that â€œSomeone I can have a beer with.â€ But then, itâ€™s like WHY. I wouldnâ€™t choose a candidate over beer price only, but we do care about it eh? 

After a long day, sit down and grab a beer. Inflation makes it hard to afford beers. Did beer community fail to speak up more to peer beer drinkers, to protect ourâ€¦.rights to beer?"

They informed me that a previous sales rep was able to collect around 100 accounts in 2 months through remote work. 

I just want to make sure that come December (when I start), I can take off running and begin contacting accounts.  I've started creating a list of prospects, but plan to update that information and put in CRM whenever I make initial contact in Decemeber. However, outside of that I'm a little lost on where to start. 

For any current beer reps, how do you structure your days/how would you to fit in contacting around 8 new leads/day? Also, how would you approach contacting bars and making calls face-to-face? Also, how do I make a proposal. "

One of the things I had loved about Asheville and WNC was the abundance and diversity of the breweries. Big or small, corporate or quirky - always fun and willing to try new things. Known as ""Beer City"". The destruction from Helene and the water crisis have devastated the beer community from the largest to the smallest.

I heard that some are still trying to operate or are shifting production or are being creative to stay in business. 

How can we support those struggling to keep things flowing? I have mostly drank locally and want to continue to do that. Do some of the smaller breweries have outlets for product so that we can keep them going until better days. Love to know everyone's thoughts. Cheers."

Very, very old looking bottle design; not perfectly cylindrical, but wider and stouter. Bottle maybe had a little bit of embossed text?
The one we found was a dark beer, I want to say oat stout. From the UK. I believe the label said how it was brewed in an old church or at least used the well of an old church/abbey. These details keep turning up Sam Smith but that's not the one. Sam Smith has a cylindrical bottle and the label covers more of it. The fabled beer didn't have the yellow color scheme either. I'm fairly confident it was in fact from the UK and not a Belgian one but perhaps that's memory playing tricks.

I am landing on Monday morning in Brussels and was thinking of hopping a train to Bruges right away to spend 2 nights there and then come back to Brussels for 3 nights. I'm taking a train to Frankfurt on Saturday so figured it would be best to do Brussels last. 

Are most places still open in December? Does the weather affect public transportation much? How difficult is it to get out to the Westvleteren cafe via public transportation? Any recommendations for places to visit otherwise are always appreciated as well. My sour tolerance is not what it once was so while I'll probably at least swing by Cantillon I will probably try to stick to the more funky and non-sour side of things.

I come to you with a kind of peculiar question, since you lot seem to be the most knowledgeable with regards to that.
I have a dear friend who can, for allergy reasons, not drink wine in any form. However, she would really like to know what it tastes like/have at least an approximation. I want to help her out. I distinctly remember once drinking a beer called â€œNottinghamâ€ by Kehrwieder Kreativbrauerei from Hamburg â€“ while it definitely did not taste the same as wine, for someone who has never drunk any wine I would say it could be an okay approximation in a more interesting way than drinking, say, single-grape juice.
So my question to you: Did you lot ever have a barleywine that tasted a little bit/as close as possible to actual (red) wine? I would buy a Nottingham, but they do not seem to make it anymore. I am situated in Northern Germany, but for this special friend and project I would be ready to import a beer from anywhere.

Beer Core Memories: Foster's Premium,11,1g96jbv,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1g96jbv/beer_core_memories_fosters_premium/,9,2024-10-22 08:29:42,"Foster's Premium, their green can, is my favorite boomer beer. For whatever reason they have the reputation of being an Australian beer when they're actually English I think. I like they because of the bulky size of their single cans, their good reliable malty tasty which I enjoyed many times while munching on countless Japanese style peanuts, and finally because I have a core memory associated with the beer.

I was during one of my college Summers my Dad flew me out to his apartment in Newcastle for an internship. It was an exciting time, but I was depressed in college and my parent's relationships were at a nadir, I wouldn't know it at the time but they'd eventually divorce.

Case in point it was a sad time in my life. When I finally reached his apartment I was so tired, a heavy, sleep deprived body tiredness. My Dad bought me the beer and brought me some wasabi flavored Japanese peanuts from Switzerland. They tasted amazing and the beer really helped me relax. I remember just sitting in his living room couch enjoying my ""dinner"" just before a nice warm shower. I wasn't watching anything on TV, just catching up with Dad.

  
What core memories have you guys formed with beer?"

My fiancÃ© and his dad used to get a growler and beer for a long time neighbor every Halloween but his dad passed away earlier this year. We donâ€™t know the kind of beer his dad used to buy but we wanted to uphold the old tradition. 

We could ask, but we kind of want it to be a surprise since the tradition kind of fazed out after my father in law moved away and leaving us the house to live in. Also, itâ€™s become a little more rare seeing our neighbor outside and striking up a convo.

So of course this is purely subjective and can be a hit or miss, but Iâ€™m curious, what kind of beer would you suggest for a 70+ Midwestern man?

EDIT: Just thought Iâ€™d add; I know little to nothing about beer so hopefully this isnâ€™t a dumb question. But if itâ€™s not too dumb, any suggestions, whether itâ€™s different brands or types/ingredients, anything would be helpful!

EDIT 2: We ended up getting a decently well liked lager from a local brewery. Thank you so much for all of your suggestions and recommendations! "

* **Environmental Impact**: Cans 4/5, Bottles 2/5
   * *Cans are lighter and easier to recycle, while bottles are heavier and more energy-intensive to produce.*
* **Portability & Convenience**: Cans 5/5, Bottles 2/5
   * *Cans win for outdoor adventures and stack easily, while bottles are heavier and breakable.*
* **Cost**: Cans 4/5, Bottles 2/5
   * *Cans are more affordable to produce and transport, while bottles, due to their weight, haveÂ a higher price tag.*

Why are American Oktoberfest beer all so dark?! ,107,1g7ik8r,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1g7ik8r/why_are_american_oktoberfest_beer_all_so_dark/,69,2024-10-20 03:59:19,"Oktoberfest Marzen beers made by the six Munich breweries each year for the festival on the Theresienwiese are all pretty light colored.

Yet for some reason, whenever I get an â€œOktoberfest styleâ€ beer from an American brewery (micro or macro) they seem to be much darker, looking much closer to an amber or even a red then to a Pilsner or lager. 

Does anyone know why this is? Why arenâ€™t they trying to match the actual Oktoberfest beer as made by the breweries that actually serve it at Oktoberfest??

Butâ€¦ Iâ€™m tired. Iâ€™m tired of thinking about it, running around to get the best one. 

I feel like Iâ€™m easing into my â€œCarlsbergâ€ years. I just want to stock my fridge with a 24 and not overthink it. Iâ€™m ready for a house beer.

The problem is, despite all the craft breweries around, Iâ€™m finding it hard to nail one down that fits my criteria, so Iâ€™m hoping for some help.

Hereâ€™s what I am looking for:
-available in 355cans or even better 341bottles.
-ideally available in bulk and not TOO expensive though that is relative and am willing to pay if needed
-ideally craft beer but Iâ€™m starting to think none will fit this bill so open to â€˜gaspâ€™ macro
-5%abv or less
-available in Ontario - and delivery across Ontario as Iâ€™m in Kingston

So far, Iâ€™ve tried
-Muskoka detour (not as good as it used to be. I had high hopes for this one but nope)
-lug lite (not off the table but not great)
-Muskoka tread lightly (loathed it)
-miller high life (sad to this this one is currently in the lead :()
-miller lite (tied with high life)
-side launch light lager (this one isnâ€™t bad)
-Modelo especial (donâ€™t like the beer but has a little skunk that is nostalgic which I kinda did)
-blood brothers blood light (this is my top beer from the category but get expensive since they donâ€™t sell by the case and need to pay shipping)
-Carlsberg (didnâ€™t try because you canâ€™t get in bottles anywhere around here)


On a side note: I LOATHE that every craft brewery is doing tall boys right now. IMHO if youâ€™re doing a light beer and putting it in tall boys youâ€™re doing it wrong. (I assume this was LCBOâ€™s doing so reckon they deserve the blame). 

Pretty close to just giving up and officially starting my Miller years."

"What would it take for British style ales (Bitters, Milds, and Pales) to become popular in the US again?",26,1g1ohus,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1g1ohus/what_would_it_take_for_british_style_ales_bitters/,58,2024-10-12 07:40:57,"The beer that really kickstarted my love of beer was Fuller's ESB. Before I had that when I was 21, I really only drank craft beers because they were stronger and could give you a good buzz faster (Victory Golden Monkey, Lagunitas Brown Shugga, Weyerbacher Merry Monks, etc). But I started reading around and trying new beers and styles for the fun of it, not just to get drunk. I'll always remember having Fuller's ESB for the first time. I was so amazed by the whole experience of how complex the malts were, how much I loved the fruity esters, and how the herbal hops used really balanced it all out. This was in around 2018-ish, and unfortunately since then so many English ales aren't available anymore. Fuller's ESB is gone. Hobgoblin ruby isn't available near me anymore. The more mass produced examples (which weren't really as good anyway) have also disappeared (red hook ESB, honker's ale etc).   


Last April I had the privelidge of going to NERAX (New England Real Ale Exhibiton) and got to try so many cask ales from the UK and US. I'm 27, but I felt like a baby there with the average age probably being in the mid-to-late 40s. It was fascinating to learn how influential British beer styles and brewing culture were to the early craft beer movement in the US. Now, coming upon a British style at a store or a brewery is extemely uncommon. 

  
My question is this. Right now in the US, lagers are making a huge comeback as people are looking for something drinkable and lower ABV that is sessionable. Why aren't British styles a part of this resurgence? They are often even lower in ABV than many lager styles, and are often much more complex and interesting. From an economic standpoint, I believe they are also cheaper to brew as they do not require extended storage. What gives? What's stopping these amazing styles from becoming more of a staple in the craft beer scene in the US?"

Picture this. Ontario. 1988.

Iâ€™m a 9 year old boy. My dad leaves the room, and I take a sip of his beer. Itâ€™s gross. I hate it. But the taste makes an imprint.

Skunky. A bit vegetal.

I grew up, got into craft beer. IPAs, DIPAs, Imperial Stouts, sours.

All great - but Iâ€™ve still yet to taste that taste that I remember.

The closest was a Pacifico on vacation once. But I canâ€™t get that in Ontario.

The only clue I have is that I know my dad drank Oâ€™keefe at one point. But I canâ€™t get that here.

I imagine itâ€™s a taste found in macro beer? Iâ€™ve tried a couple with no luck. I tried Miller Lite and it had a hint of it in the first sip but then it disappeared.

So, I guess Iâ€™m wondering, what beers should I try that might have that nostalgic, skunky, mildly vegetal 80s dad beer taste? Know what I mean?"

My mom had a regular 12oz bottle of MHL in her fringe for months and didnâ€™t have any other beer so I took it upon myself to drink it and it tasted awful. Wasnâ€™t very bubbly for being the champagne of beers and had an extremely sweet corn syrupy flavor to it. I ended up only drinking half of it and havenâ€™t had it again until this week.

Earlier this week I was dying for a beer and was a day away from payday so I settled for a $1.69 32 oz bottle of Miller Highlife and it was so good I had to go by three more today. Perfect balance of light and flavorful. Easily chuggable and pleasantly sippable.

My question is, has any of you noticed MHL tasting better out of the big bottles as opposed to the standard 12oz variety? Or was the one in my momâ€™s fridge just too old? Iâ€™ve finished all three and have yet to taste that offputting sweet corn syrupy note."

From Burial Brewing: How to support Asheville after Helene,141,1fv9k0w,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1fv9k0w/from_burial_brewing_how_to_support_asheville/,12,2024-10-03 21:49:55,"Hi everybody -

The team at Burial Brewing in Asheville has been feeding the community and directing folks to fundraisers as they recover from the catastrophic flooding of Hurricane Helene (I know others like DSSOLVR are helping, but they're who I follow on Instagram). I emailed them to see if I could donate to them to help them with their efforts, and [as promised](https://old.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1fu4fei/asheville_breweries_devastated_by_helene_flooding/lq2fzz1/), here's the email I received:

---

Good Morning Folks,

I want to start by saying thank you to each of you who reached out to offer support. Itâ€™s been overwhelming to keep up with in the best possible way. Hearing from you is keeping us optimistic and moving forward. Iâ€™d also like to thank you for your patience as we tried to wrap our heads around where and how to direct these offers.

Weâ€™ve spent the past few days sorting through the abundance of information thatâ€™s out there and have settled on the following as a start.

**For those looking to support Asheville and WNC:**

* **Overview** - These three resources below have been the most reliable and all-encompassing that we have found so far:

**For those looking to support Burial Beer Co.:**

* **Overview** - As of Tuesday, October 1st, we have been in contact with 100% of Burial's Asheville Staff. Everyone is safe and accounted for. We're considering ourselves incredibly lucky that our Asheville locations did not sustain any major damage. Unfortunately, many of our friends and neighbors cannot say the same. Our timeline on reopening any Burial AVL locations will largely rely on the city's ability to re-establish a potable and running water supply, which we've heard may take weeks and up to months. That being said, our main focus right now is supplying hot meals, cold water, dry goods, feminine products, gas, and electricity to both our staff and the community.
* **Physical Donations** -
Both our Charlotte and Raleigh Taprooms are accepting donations that will be delivered to our South Slope Asheville Taproom. Additionally, UPS and FedEx have resumed service to Asheville. If you're interested and able to send dry goods, feminine products, or bottled water, our address is:
  * [40 Collier Ave, Asheville, NC 28801](https://www.google.com/maps/search/40+Collier+Ave,+Asheville,+NC+28801?entry=gmail&source=g)
* **Volunteering** -
We are thankful to have the resources on our staff to handle our limited Asheville operations at the moment. For those of you looking to volunteer, we'd like to direct you to: volunteer@buncombecounty.org.
* **Financial Support** -
  * [GoFundMe for Asheville Hospitality Staff](https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-asheville-coworkers-in-recovery-together) - Our Charlotte Taproom Manager, Alissa Gavin, has created a fund that will benefit our AVL Bartenders and Kitchen Employees currently unable to work. 
  * [Charlotte](https://burialbeer.com/pages/charlotte-house-of-relics) & [Raleigh](https://burialbeer.com/pages/raleigh-the-exhibit) Taprooms - Both locations are currently open with standard operations. Come say hi to our teams, enjoy some pours, and take some beer to-go.
  * [Online Shop](https://burialbeer.com/pages/delivery-asheville-pickup) - Our Online Shop for Beer and Merchandise Shipping is active. We're working to catch up on orders received during the storm, as well as the new orders coming in each day. Shipping will likely be a bit slower than you're used to from us, but we will get you the goods as soon as we possibly can.
I know this is a lot, but please let me know if you have any questions. I will do my best to get back to everyone as quickly as possible.


Thank you,
The Burial Beer Co. Team"

> These are the sectors that could be the most impacted by the strike:

> Food and Beverage: The dozen or so U.S. ports affected by the strike import nearly $100 million a month of beverages and vinegar, according to a report from the Washington Post. According to the American Farm Bureau Federation via the Washington Post, 80% of all imported beer, whiskey, scotch and more come through the ports will be impacted by the strike.

> Constellation Brands. The maker of Modelo, is one of the companies that imports the most beer to the U.S., although Constellation may be able to avoid disruptions caused by the port through ground transportation from Mexico. Heineken NV and other European beverage companies may feel more of the strikeâ€™s affects.

The longshoreman strikes on the East Coast may cause the prices on imported beer, wine, and spirits to increase, as well as supply to decrease.  Some of the more popular imported brands like Modelo, Corona, Guinness and Heineken may see price increases and be harder to find.  If you regularly drink imported beer, you may want to stock up in case prices increase."

ColdFire Brewingâ€™s â€œFlavor Policeâ€ â€“ A Rant About Customer Choice and Brewery Elitism,0,1fv2ccb,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1fv2ccb/coldfire_brewings_flavor_police_a_rant_about/,34,2024-10-03 14:36:25,"Iâ€™ve got to say, Iâ€™ve had some great times at ColdFire Brewing Company in Eugene, Oregon. They make solid beer, and Iâ€™ve enjoyed supporting a local spot. But tonight? They really lost me with one of the most pretentious policies Iâ€™ve ever come across in any brewery.

Iâ€™ve been to breweries all over the country and made the same simple request at all of them: half IPA, half cider. I like the sweetness of the cider mixed with the hoppiness of the IPAâ€”itâ€™s a combo that works for me. But apparently, ColdFire doesnâ€™t care what its customers like. When I ordered this, the server told me itâ€™s company policy not to honor requests like this because (Iâ€™m paraphrasing here), the brewers work â€œreally hardâ€ to create flavor profiles, and customers need to â€œhonor that.â€ Yeah, really.

What? I thought I walked into a brewery, not the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld. â€œNo mixed drinks for you!â€ I made that exact comparison to the server, who looked at me like Iâ€™d just insulted their entire family. Seriously, though, the snobby disdain in the response was just off-putting.

And hereâ€™s the thing: Iâ€™ve never had a pub, bar, or brewery deny this simple request, which Iâ€™ve made dozens of times over many years at all kinds of places. But ColdFire? Theyâ€™re so wrapped up in their self-importance that they actually enforce this ridiculous policy, as if theyâ€™re doing us a favor by refusing what we like.

And letâ€™s get one thing straightâ€”denying a customerâ€™s requestâ€”even if it seems a bit weirdâ€”should NEVER be a company policy at a food and beverage establishment or anywhere in the service industry. The customerâ€™s preferences reign supreme, especially over the pride and ego of the chefs or, in this case, the brewers. Customers come to enjoy themselves, not be told their tastes are wrong.

FOOD AND DRINK IS PERSONAL. What tastes good to one person might taste like absolute trash to another. People alter their food and drinks to suit their own tastes all the time. Imagine a steakhouse refusing to give you salt because â€œthe chef seasoned it to perfection,â€ or an ice cream shop rejecting your request for two different flavors because â€œour chef determined those donâ€™t go together.â€ Itâ€™s absurd, right? But here we are.

ColdFire, youâ€™ve officially become one of the most pretentious and out-of-touch establishments in Eugene. Congratulations. Newsflash: customers come to enjoy themselves, not to bow down to some snobby, self-important idea of what â€œshouldâ€ be good. And the fact that Iâ€™ve never had a single other place deny this request? That just makes your policy all the more ridiculous.

So, has anyone else had this experience? Is this really the hill ColdFire wants to die on? Curious to hear if this is a one-off or if other people have noticed a shift in the customer experience here. Also curious if anyone knows the name of the owner(s)."

Do you think it's safe to tap this upcoming Friday(So the beer would be 14 days tapped)? I'm not as concerned with taste, after all, it is keg beer, more with general safety.

What can i get for them, we're in colorado and they're blue collar.",107,1fsh1pk,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1fsh1pk/not_a_beer_drinker_neighbors_are_and_they_helped/,72,2024-09-30 05:51:11,"I asked what they'd want and they said ""whatever""

I've seen them with a beer in a yellow and black case. I haven't bought beer in like 15 years.

Any recommendations would be helpful.


EDIT: Thank you everyone for the comments. Overwhelming suggestions for Coors Banquet made me decide. They seemed to have been quite content with a large case of that as well as some brownies and cookies. It's Sunday and they had kids over and took 10 minutes out of their evening to help my dumbass move a couch up a flight of stairs that I idiotically thought I could do with just a dolly.

Also, to those wondering what being blue collar has to do with anything. People in different types of jobs prefer different things. I'm not saying either is better or worse, I just know that preferences are more prevalent in different fields. "

Using a c-DGM Gehaltemeter for RTD,1,1fsucz5,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1fsucz5/using_a_cdgm_gehaltemeter_for_rtd/,1,2024-09-30 19:31:14,"Hello Hello, I have a question slightly outside the beer topic, but I know some breweries also produce RTD beverages. The other day, we were canning Cuba Libre, and something happened with the carbonation. Everything was measured using a c-DGM Gehaltemeter Haffmans CO2/O2, calibrated and clean:

* Carbonation in the BBT: 2.71 vol.
* Carbonation inline, at the filler inlet: 2.70 vol.
* Carbonation in the cans (average of 35 cans): 2.14 vol.

The cans were randomly selected from the packaging line and refrigerated until they reached an approximate temperature of 32-33 Â°F.

My question is the following: during the measurement, if I didnâ€™t fully open the flow on the equipment, the temperature didnâ€™t drop enough, showing a higher reading (the liquid was about 33 Â°F, but the equipment read 37 Â°F). For this type of product, where Iâ€™m only measuring CO2, what is the correct procedure? (I've never got this kind of problems with the beer, so, im asking for RTD).  Should I fully open the flow until the measurement stabilizes? If so, why does the pressure drop so much, and consequently the carbonation, when there was no breakout or foaming during filling?

Additionally, could it be that the CO2 loss is happening during filling and not due to incorrect measurement? Since this beverage has no proteins (unlike beer, which does allow CO2 retention), would it be advisable to add some additive to improve foam retention in the liquid? Thanks any comment is welcome!"

So as of last Friday, Iâ€™m now 21!!! To be honest for a second, Iâ€™ve had some beers here or there in the last year at family get togethers and parties with friends.

I want to see whatâ€™s out there in the beer world, try a little bit of everything I suppose! If it helps, the beers Iâ€™ve had so far are as follows:

-Bud Light
-Samuel Adams (Oktoberfest, Winter Lager, Summer Ale)
-Corona 
- Blue Moon

Given the ones I listed, I really enjoyed the Samuel Adams flavors the most. Blue Moon being second place, Corona third, and Bud Light being last. Thatâ€™s not because I donâ€™t like it, it just doesnâ€™t excite my palate much.

I'm a Belgian visiting London soon, so I'm looking for some beer recommendations. This isn't my first visit to London, but it will be the first visit since my ""discovery"" that I like the sweeter brown ales. Those include Rochefort 10, Gouden Carolus Imperial Dark, Chimay Bleu, Gulden Draak Classic, Sint-Bernardus Abt 12 and my absolute favourite : Kasteel Donker. 

I've been doing some research online, and it has lead me to things like milk stout, oatmeal stout, tropical stout and honey beer. I have to admit that I've ignored stout beers due to disliking Guinness. But apparently that's an imperial stout? The guesthouse I'm staying at is above an Irish pub, so I'm assuming they'll have quite a few stouts for me to try.

My current ""list"" of beers to try (or bring with me) consists of only 2 beers atm : Left Hand Nitro Milk Stout and Samuel Smith oatmeal stout. I'd love to expand this list with some other sweet British beers. Doesn't necessarily have to be stout.

After the 16th century, beers began to regularly include this ingredient. For years, only a mixture of herbs and spices was used to slightly alter its flavor, around the 1100s AD.

The nun **Hildegard von Bingen** (1098-1179), in a German monastery, wrote a treatise on the benefits of hops, beer, and the use of hops in it. Based on the fact that sweet drinks were heavily consumed, which led to vision problems and blindness, Hildegard suggested that the bitterness of beer counteracted the overconsumption of such beverages.

Thanks to Hildegard, hops were identified as growing in the chapel of Bavaria and became recognized as a key ingredient in beer. It wasnâ€™t until 1400 that hops reached the Netherlands, and in 1519 it was condemned as a bad herb. Not until the 16th century was it included as a basic ingredient."

Canadian Beer Drinkers: Beware of Imports Brewed Under Contract.,0,1fo36yx,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1fo36yx/canadian_beer_drinkers_beware_of_imports_brewed/,45,2024-09-24 10:25:24,"Miller Lite shouldnâ€™t be that difficult to copy. Yet it tastes like Molson. The Wisconsin Miller Lite has a very distinct pils nose and flavor.

Guinness Extra Stout. Itâ€™s %0.4 weaker than the Irish version. It lacks body, flavor, and is fizzy as if thereâ€™s zero nitro in it. Nitro or not itâ€™s just way more fizzy and empty tasting.

Grolsch. Honestly itâ€™s been awhile since I drank an original. But this is flabby and barely palatable. It should be a little more hop sharp and slightly sea sprayâ€™esque.

The problem here is if youâ€™ve never experienced the originals you either like the under contract versions for what they are or you donâ€™t. And I think that Molson and maybe a little less so Labatt, have always wanted to homogenize and lower the expectations of the beer drinking experience.

Or perhaps this is a result of their vertical integration of procuring grains and hops, combined with their standardized brewing process.

Either way Iâ€™m done with these companies. If you agree contact your local convenience stores and grocery to pressure them to have variety."

I've listed a few I found below: 

- New Belgium Brewing (Colorado, USA):Â This brewery is a pioneer in the sustainable beer movement. They run on 100% wind power, have an impressive water conservation system, and even use a methane-powered co-gen engine to turn waste into energy. Plus, they're a certified B Corporation, which is always good!

- Camden Town Brewery (Camden Town, London):Â Despite supporting the worst team in North London, Camden Town Brewery is dedicated to sustainability, using 100% renewable electricity, recycling brewing waste, and minimising material use in packaging. They also conserve water and collaborate with local farmers and a UK charity to reduce environmental impact.

- Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. (California, USA):Â Known for their zero-waste initiative, Sierra Nevada recycles or reuses nearly 100% of their waste. They've also invested heavily in solar energy and have one of the largest privately-owned solar arrays in the U.S. Their commitment to water conservation and sustainable agriculture is also top-notch.

- To Ã˜l (Copenhagen, Denmark):Â To Ã˜l operates out of a facility they've dubbed ""To Ã˜l City,"" which is all about zero-waste and circular economy principles. They're using local, organic ingredients and innovative packaging solutions that make their operations as sustainable as possible.

What other sustainable breweries do you know of? Before anyone mentions BrewDog, please do look at the shit show that company has become. "

I am in Saigon Vietnam now and grabbed a few Asahis at 7-11 but the moment I took a sip from the first one, I knew something was off.  Not only did it not taste the same, but I have never tasted a beer that tasted like some sort of chemical in my entire life.  It was very pronounced.  I cracked open another one and same thing.  I asked my wife to take a sip and she immediately agreed something is way off.  I then inspected the can and it said this on the side. 

â€œby Shenzhen Tsingtao Beer
Asahi Breweries, Ltd., Tokyoâ€
www.asahisuperdry.com

I assumed it was from Japan, but I guess it is a Chinese brewed one, but why so different and why such an awful chemical taste?  Surely Asahi has quality control?  What could have caused this?  Left in the hot sun?  Did I drink a fake beer?   Has anyone had this experience with other beers?  

Also, unsure if related, but about an hour after having those sips (maybe 2 oz/60ml total) my toes on both my feet suddenly curled up with the most intense cramp I have ever experienced and it took 30 mins of massage and hot water to calm them down. I rarely get cramped toes and never for more than a second or two on one foot so this was a big surprise.  So much so that it has me wondering if that beer was poison in some way?  I looked into causes of extreme toe cramps and the only possible thing that jumped out was poisoning as there was no other cause that rang as even possible.  

Will post on a Vietnam subreddit as maybe the locals have some insights.

My favorite is Colt .45, it's just so smooth and silky, slight sweetness, but still malty, almost like drinking a bowl of cereal. I think the taste is superior to Mickey's, and it hits smoother than Olde English, Steele Reserve, and Cobra; in that it doesn't get you drunk off the second sip.

The price is still cheaper than water, and has a good kick, without making you gag as it doesn't taste like IPAs."

Our lines are cleaned professionally (lol) by a guy every week

My question is the following : can Somebody give me some explanation in re the worldwide hops trend ? What I mean is : what happened ? I remember my earlier youth (I'm 34 now), when I was in my teens, in Chile, and nowhere would You find anything termed Â« IPA Â», or Â« APA Â», nor any Â« special Â» beer, and no beer would have hops flavour. All there was was bottled beers (or canned) which You'd get at shops, and they were just... what I'd call Â« regular Â» beers. No hops.

But then all of a sudden (well, if You can call a decade or couple of decades as Â« sudden Â»), suddenly hops everywhere. And specialty beers, and bars that make their special beers, etc. And it seems to Me that this happened quite all over the world. Again : IPAs, APAs, ales, hops and hops.

Can Somebody explain ?, if there's something to be explained beyond just telling Me Â« it's a trend Â» ?

Beers similar to Guinness Extra Stout?

Anyhow, I was just drinking an Augustiner Festbier on my one weekend home in Munich (Iâ€™m American my wife is from here) and I was wondering what the ranking of the classic six Oktoberfest biers are. I have a pretty good idea of where the six breweriesâ€™ helles beers sit (Augustiner, Hacker Pschorr, Paulaner, HofbrÃ¤u, Spaten, LÃ¶wenbrÃ¤u are how they stack up according to the Germans I know more than or less) but I was a little less than pleased with my Augustiner Fest that I thought perhaps the ranking is different. What are the thoughts here about the OG six festbier and how they stack up against one another? "

I usually donâ€™t really enjoy beer or the taste of alcohol But I always say yes to any drink thatâ€™s offered to me to atleast give it a shot. 

Friend brought over a Dragons Milk and some bourbons after I had a Guinness and sip of some other alcohol earlier that night.  All of them were okay but I just didnâ€™t like the bourbons.  I tried the dragons milk thoughâ€¦btw I wasnâ€™t drunk only maybe slightly floaty. I took one sip and instantlyâ€¦..this was such an AMAZING DRINK. The sweetness and fruitiness and darkerâ€¦idk undertones?? I couldnâ€™t believe my taste buds. Loved every sip of it.  I need this again. 

Canâ€™t remember what kind it was though. Definitely not the crimson. I donâ€™t know if it was the Stout or Triple Mash but I need it again.  I do know for sure it wasnâ€™t the crimson or a flavor like for example Oatmeal.  I got a 4 pack of the stout yesterdayâ€¦.but it doesnâ€™t taste like what I remembered. It wasnâ€™t as sweet or fruity.

Does anyone know what Iâ€™m looking for and can point me in the right direction? I donâ€™t have that friends number so I canâ€™t contact him for it. "

I used to drink Reddâ€™s Apple Ale, but now I donâ€™t even enjoy that.
Iâ€™m not looking to get tanked, Iâ€™m just looking for something nice to sip on after work. 
Iâ€™ve done some online research for about 2 weeks now, and have gone and done a pick your own 6pack from the local store.
The only thing Iâ€™ve liked so far is Angry Orchard cider, and thatâ€™s after letting it go semi-flat. 
I donâ€™t like a heavy or overpowering wheat flavor, Iâ€™m a fan of sour/fruity, but flavor matters to me way more than it probably should. 

Drinks Iâ€™ve tried so far:
Shock Top
Lazy Hiker IPA
Sam Adams Cherry Wheat (smelled great tasted awful)
Angry Orchard (liked)
Heineken (didnâ€™t enjoy, but didnâ€™t hate)

CO2/Keg advice,3,1fgr3vn,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1fgr3vn/co2keg_advice/,4,2024-09-15 00:17:58,"Hello. I am having a problem with my new keg setup and Iâ€™m having trouble finding anyone with a similar issue online. 

I got this set up a month ago. Two sixel kegs in a kegerator hooked up to two taps. I have attached a 5 lb CO2 tank to the kegs. 

For the first week it ran no problems. The pours were foamy but after fiddling with the pressure levels I got it pouring well. Then the CO2 tank ran out with both kegs still about half full. I rubbed soap on all the points of escape and found a leak, applied sealant to it and it stopped leaking there. Hooked up a new tank and it poured well, but less than a week later, same problem. The kegs were empty now, replaced them, hooked up a new tank and couldnâ€™t find another leak. 

This is the part where Iâ€™m not finding anyone with the same issue. I followed some instructions I found online:

1. pressurize the regulator until the low pressure gauge is reading 10 psi

2. close the valve between the regulator and the hose and shut off the tank 

The instructions said the pressure should stay the same. What happened was they stayed the same for two minutes, then quickly increased to 25 psi, before suddenly dropping to zero. I tried this twice and the same thing happened each time. 

This is a full tank of CO2 and when I set everything up normally it is pouring beer out of both taps no issue, but I am confused about why my tanks are going empty so fast. 

Has anyone had an issue like this before? Iâ€™m thinking I may need to replace the regulator? Iâ€™m not sure what other troubleshooting to do and I want advice from people more experienced than me before I spend more money on this thing. 

Thank you. "

I planned on getting some cheap insulated jackets for them and I want to get two containers I can set them in and fill will ice. They'll be inside the venue for the reception.

I see a keg is about 16"" diameter and I'm seeing containers that are a 17.5"" width. Do I need something wider? Taller? What would you recommend? I'm picking them up from a local bar, and the guy said he would keep them in the 40 degree cooler in the back for me with their other kegs, do I even need the insulated jackets?

I'm looking for advice...

I am looking to add 6 new draught keg beer lines to my licensed premesis which I own freehold. Currently there is no celllar and I have no taps.

I have all planning and licensing in order for a new cellar area and 6 lines, the cellar being behind the current bar (under 5 meters from keg to tap in a straight line) I am very capable doing any building out work, drilling walls for trunking, connecting things up ect.

However my knowledge of how to design this system is limited to speaking with equipment suppliers and reading/watching websites/YouTube.

At the moment Im thinking I could have a stab at creating this system, buying and installing the parts myself. However I'm concerned I may hit pitfalls or poorly design it. 

I will not be doing the phyiaical cellar room build or the electrics/cellar cooling myself. I am only considering creating the keg draught system.

Is there any good information/resources/recommend training you can share given the above.

If I'm way off the mark and I'm crazy to even attempt it, please let me know aswell.

Thank you.

Currently at IDV again and have it in front of me. Either something changed in the brewing process, Iâ€™m having a stroke, or theyâ€™re pushing beer out too quickly because this one isnâ€™t great. I feel like Iâ€™m tasting it in the middle of fermentation or something.
Very ethanol-heavy and unpalatable in the finish, I actually made a face on the first sip and I keep going back trying to convince myself Iâ€™m crazy to no avail. I had this beer like 4 days ago to run through my supply from last year and finished the glass in under 20m. This version reminds me of Decaâ€™s beer.

The 6 was fantastic, the 8 tasted young but was drinkable, and the 12 is more than unpalatable. Did something happen? Should I see a doctor?"

PSA for Guinness drinkers: Guinness seems to keep extending their $5 rebate program,99,1fammom,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1fammom/psa_for_guinness_drinkers_guinness_seems_to_keep/,23,2024-09-07 01:43:02,"I've been using this for maybe a year or so now. While it used to be seasonal.... it seems they're currently keeping this going indefinitely as it's now been extended until the end of the year. To me, Guinness is a great session beer that is widely available, but my main complaint has always been that it's just a touch too expensive for what it is. This rebate knocks it down to the $1 per 12oz territory (if you're buying the nitro 8 packs), which is pretty great (it's about $15-16 at my grocery store).

I buy Guinness semi-regularly so I've been taking full advantage. The money is typically venmoed to you in a few days.  I think there's a limit of 4 uses per month per person.

The year of Festbier (In America)?,54,1f9w6ji,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1f9w6ji/the_year_of_festbier_in_america/,51,2024-09-06 03:12:09,"Just checking out my local total wine and their OFest selections, after having the hardest time last year finding any festbier (literally just one single variety) this year I count at least 6. Sierra Nevadaâ€™s selection this year is a festbier as well. Is this the year it finally makes it big in America alongside the traditional MÃ¤rzen?

For the unaware, there are two styles of German Oktoberfest bier. In America, we generally only see the older style called MÃ¤rzen, which is an amber very malty style that was traditionally aged half a year (hence the name. Most is not aged nowadays and the flavor is achieved via other means though some still age theirs). 

The more modern variant is known as festbier and is somewhere in between a MÃ¤rzen and a standard helles lager. Malty, slightly hoppy, easy drinking with a surprising kick of alcohol. It was generally very hard to find in the US outside of certain imports, compared to MÃ¤rzen. "

Let's define commonly as being able to reliably find a pub with real ale in any city. Real ale is defined as ""Beer brewed from traditional ingredients, matured by secondary fermentation in the container from which it is dispensed, and served without the use of extraneous carbon dioxide."" by Wiktionary.

The reason why I ask is that I love bitter but will probably have to leave the UK for some years at least to pursue a career in academia.

Edit: some confusion about real ale vs ale. Real ale is a subset of ale. It has been pointed out to me that a better word to use might be cask beer. I'm not asking where you can get any ale because Guinness is ubiquitous but not what I want."

Well to me it had a strong aroma of alcohol, maybe like a port wine,  it looked like used motor oil in the glass.  It had left some funky brown deposits on the blue glass bottle.  I tried it and immediately thought of a port wine that is starting to turn, I would drink it in small quantities.  Maybe a addition to some winter cocktail creation.  The wife's reaction is a bit more intense, I really wish I could post a photo of the face she made.  The works out her mouth were ""yuck, rancid, how the hell can you drink that"".

My next thought was to try a triple bock spriz.  presico,  triple bock and club soda. Maybe that would help.

Maybe as a base or beer bread?

He will only drink Boddingtons and Belhaven Scottish Ale/Belhaven Black Stout now, with the occasional FORGD Stout or Guinness Draught at the bar or when a restaurant wonâ€™t let you BYO.

If not, how would I go about importing it? Itâ€™s for personal use, obviously, but would I need a permit or documents for it?

Iâ€™ve been sampling cask ales around town (Stockholm) and so far been let down. Right now Iâ€™m trying Timothy Taylorâ€™s Boltmaker (tried Knowle Spring Blonde too) from a reputable bar (it has the â€œCask Marqueâ€ certification and a Timothy Taylor Champion Club plaque)

To me, the beer is slightly too warm (not cold enough), slightly too flat, and lacking anything that stands out flavor wise. I get that the point is for it to be this way, but the only substance Iâ€™m getting is a tea like astringency. A little dusty. 

The only one Iâ€™ve liked decent was a darker mild; it felt more appropriate for a darker beer, creamier, smooth. 

I respect these bars so maybe itâ€™s just a me thing. I havenâ€™t traveled to the UK and wonâ€™t give up yet. But for now Iâ€™d prefer the beer on normal draft. "

Ale Lager Hybrid available in Chicago? Pretty new to beer ðŸº ,1,1ey8unf,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1ey8unf/ale_lager_hybrid_available_in_chicago_pretty_new/,26,2024-08-22 10:00:31,"
Hello, 
Looking for a gift for my family. One guy likes a lager and the other prefers and Ale type of beer. Does anyone have good recommendations for a hybrid Ale/Lager? Iâ€™ve been looking but still relatively new to drinking. Iâ€™ve tried a Goose island IPA and definitely did not like it, other than that I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve tried a â€œtrueâ€ ale, so does this sub have good general information on beer? 

I live in Chicago and budget is unlimited. Just looking for a solid drink. 

Thanks again for your time!!! ðŸ™‚"

I never really got into beer until I visited Munich in 2015. Since then, Hefeweizens have been my go to beers. I've tried several, and here is my take.

Weihenstephan - this is the one where I notice variations from batch to batch, so it's a bit or miss for me. I've noticed that some have a stronger note of clove, and I really don't like them. The ones I've gotten that had strong banana note, I think are the best I've had. But again, it's inconsistent in my opinion, so it's not my go to.

KÃ¶nig Ludwig Weissbier- it's been a few years since I've had it, so I can't really comment on specifics, but I know that it's probably almost my favorite or at least top 3

Franziskaner- I don't think it's quite as good as the  best weihenstephans or Ludwig's ive had, but it's very consistent, and (at least for me) easy to find. I'd describe this one as a more bready taste.

I had some of the Hofbrau Hefeweizen last week, it was pretty good, but seemed a bit more bitter than other Hefeweizens.

Ive probably tried the Hefeweizens from most or all of the Munich breweries, but none of them were memorable enough for me to comment on or good enough for me to have continue purchasing.

What are your favorite Hefeweizens?"

El Guapo has a translucent, burnt-orange appearance, with a thin, off-white head and a bit of lacing. The aroma is of rich, dark bread crust and a possible agave touch. The flavor is of white bread crust and noticeable and unusual bitterness. El Guapo has a medium body and a mostly-dry finish."

I know some breweries will print a can date vs an expiration date, but after a quick search apparently Goose Island prints expiration dates. So I went back to the store and showed them the date on the box, and they told me I was wrong and that was the can date, and the expiration date was the one next to it. The serial code. If that were the case it would have expired on December 9th, 2002 even though it was canned on June 24th, 2024. Apparently they think beer retro-expires and they wouldnâ€™t have it, and not wanting to start an argument, I just took it and left. Even if it was December 2024, I would think hop character would significantly degrade in that amount of time.

There are always those people at the bar that add a pinch of salt to ""enhance"" flavors or to make it less flat - IMO I'm not a fan.

Just with a quick google search, [Guinness Nitrosurge | Official Global Site](https://nitrosurge.guinness.com/en/), seems to have a device for specialty beer cans. However, you have to use special cans that are not sold in the US. IMO their US canned beer is nothing like what you get in Ireland, so if this works it would be revolutionary.

Then there are also the machines (like [Amazon.com : Chill-O-Matic Instant Beverage Cooler. You can Chill a 12 Ounce Can of Beer or Soda in just 60 Seconds with This Portable Cooling Device : Home & Kitchen](https://www.amazon.com/Chill-Matic-Automatic-Beverage-Chiller/dp/B01DFPM5PE?th=1)) that get your beer ice cold. This maybe a bigger deal for light beer.

This leads to canned Hazy IPA. These are really impacted by the time they sit on a shelf. I was wondering with the beer expects on this sub: is there are any other ways to make these canned beers taste more consistent?

Other than those above and besides tapping a keg, is there anything I'm missing?"

Craft breweries need more flagship beers.,19,1escvip,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1escvip/craft_breweries_need_more_flagship_beers/,17,2024-08-15 04:11:29,"I am constantly frustrated with many established craft breweries in my region (NYC area) rotating almost their entire selection every couple of months. The new project is always a gamble. If it's a hit, I won't be able to find it in two months. If it's a dud, it's not fun to pay $11 for the new high ABV hazy. I find myself preferring breweries distributing the flagship beer they've perfected with a couple projects I can try as well. Not every beer drinking experience needs to be a project.

My drinking buddy disagrees with me. He claims this is part of the fun of drinking craft beer and, with many of these breweries, their reputation precedes them and it's worth the gamble. I'm curious where everyone else stands on this? "

I bought variety packs, went to breweries and got flights, bought all kinds of beers from stores and gas stations and I enjoyed them a lot.

We want alcohol at our wedding, but figured we either need to have a ticketing system (yuck) or stick to beer and wine (better). We do have a bartender, but the venue does not supply any alcohol.

I suppose my questions are these:

1. Is there a better approach?
2. If not, we figured \~20-30 bottles of wine for \~150 people. How many cans of beer should we get?
3. (not really a beer drinker) What types of beer should we get? 2-4 different types?
4. Are seltzers a good compromise?

Here's a canning line."" You know the drill. 

I'll be traveling to Denver in a few weeks and was hoping someone had experience with a truly great/unique brewery tour in the area. I have been to Denver once as an adult. Only drank at a couple of places and toured O'Dell in Ft. Collins. I tend to drink with the season (more pales in the summer, stouts in the winter), but am an equal opportunity embiber.

Boy were we wrong.

Almost every pub we visited in London and Edinburgh had multiple options. Most times each new pub would have one or two she hadn't seen yet. On top of that, some places had a non-alcoholic on draught which she was incredibly excited to see (I think it was Lucky Saint that was on draft the few times we saw this).

This allowed her to pub crawl with me and have as much fun with it as I did.

It was really impressive to see how many options there were. Hopefully we see those types of options here in the states soon, especially a draught option here and there."

Sweet or minimally bitter beers?,6,1eioa5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1eioa5p/sweet_or_minimally_bitter_beers/,25,2024-08-03 06:17:14,"It's possible I'll never actually like any beers, but I find I'm very adverse to the kind of bitterness I taste in beers. I like dark chocolate a lot, coffee I tend to add a generous amount of cream and sugar to, and more often than not liquors with a lot of botanicals like gin are enjoyable. So it's not a sweeping dislike of bitterness. Are there any beers that I can look into trying that are not strongly bitter, or perhaps slightly sweet instead of bitter?"

So far I have been using Coors with lemonade as that is all they had available whilst I was on holiday, but I have became a bit too prone to the taste of Coors now and the lemonade just overpowers it. It is no longer giving me that refreshing taste!

It was brewed specially for canning in the 60s-80s in the UK, it apparently called itself a pale ale but on further inspection of old inactive beer forums it sounds like it was a sweetish lager brewed with Hallertau hops so sounds more like a German Helles, but Iâ€™m guessing this probably wouldnâ€™t taste similar. Hard to know having never tried the original. Weâ€™ve tried him on a few modern pale ales, even simpler less hoppy ones and theyâ€™re not the taste heâ€™s after.  

Does anyone know of anything that would fit the bill I could buy in the UK (London ish), that isnâ€™t Budweiser, thatâ€™s been suggested previously by friends, but heâ€™s not a fan.

Is Miller Lite a â€œredneckâ€ beer?,0,1ed9xvj,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1ed9xvj/is_miller_lite_a_redneck_beer/,45,2024-07-27 13:38:07,"hello all, this is a question for our American beer lovers on this forum.

Iâ€™m sitting here in Melbourne (Australia ) enjoying a few Miller Lite. 

This is a special occasion for us as this beer is not available here. A mate brought it over after a trip to the USA. We rarely have access to it.

Itâ€™s a special beer for us because we had an absolutely phenomenal week in Las Vegas to celebrate turning forty (eight years ago now). Many miller lite were drunk during that trip. 

Iâ€™ve been told by one of our mates that Miller Lite is considered a â€œredneck beerâ€ in the US. In fact when he was sitting on the verandah enjoying a miller lite in his last trip to the US (Washington) with his family there he was told â€œall we need is a pickup truck and a confederate flagâ€

Is miller lite a redneck beer?"

My question is: After releasing the valve on the cask to allow the secondary fermentation to take place, and having left the valve open for 48hrs, can I close the valve again and halt the secondary fermentation until the beer is ready to dispense, or does it need to be dispensed immediately after the 48hr secondary fermentation has taken place?"

I drank 33 American lagers so you don't have to,720,1ah7fq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1ah7fq1/i_drank_33_american_lagers_so_you_dont_have_to/,296,2024-02-02 23:17:41,"I've run the gamut on exploring different beer styles and have grown tired of the craft beer game. I've been drinking (good) lager most of the time lately, and have been thinking about how I've never had a shit lager phase. I drank mostly fruity vodka drinks and Crown Royal in college, and when I turned 21, I discovered the craft beer section at the grocery store and went from there. Then I started thinking, I should put together a shitty lager tasting and torture my friends! Now I've finally done it.
   
There are a lot of beers in this category, so I limited myself to 33, all American, including a handful of Michigan brewed and regional options. Most of these beers were within recommended freshness. 

We first sampled all 33 beers in one night. Getting through it all was a struggle. Trying so many similarly tasting beers in one night is *very* mentally exhausting, not to mention the exhaustion of excessive drinking. Yet, at the very end, the #1 beer was unanimously decided, and everyone's top 5 was pretty damn close. For the 4 months after the tasting, I drank several more of each to fine tune my ratings and comments. I drank them grouped by brewery, I've drank them worst to best, and I've done more side-by-sides than I can count. I questioned why I was laboring so hard over this pointless ranking... but I had to keep on going.
   
Perhaps the most eye-opening part of all this was how profoundly shitty it made me feel. The hangover made me feel so remarkably disgusting, considerably more so than craft beer ever has, and in a qualitatively different way. I'm thinking it's the dog food grade ingredients used in these shitty lagers. I hope to never feel that way again.

Anyways... on to the ranking!

#[The Killshot](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/3e3a9798fba856c2c497652d7fba5b77_c_1351703492_raw.jpeg)
    
1. [High Life](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/6a19a589b975bfbd571abcf0e4e26d0b_c_1351728906_raw.jpeg) - 4/5 - The champagne of beers is unanimous winner of the 33 shit lager showdown. Wonderfully balanced, flavorful, and clean maltiness with a well balanced hop note. This truly sets the standard for American macro lager.

2. [Pabst Blue Ribbon Extra](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/6fe817048ac162db1a589cc8fea60438_c_1351727722_raw.jpeg) - 4/5 - I am surprised by how good this is compared to regular PBR. It's bolder but tastes like better quality ingredients too. There's a bit of a spicy earthy toasty hop thing, and a more substantial maltiness and body. Great stuff! It's also the only mass market lager I found packaged using the plastic PakTech can carriers.

3. [Coors Banquet](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/7b4e5174d56b143c9a2a136b842f2154_c_1351726697_raw.jpeg) - 4/5 - Easily top 3 American shit lagers. Super clean crispy malts, light balanced hops, a touch of sweetness, and an almost creamy carbonation profile. It just tastes good.

4. [Hamms](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/86fd4815d92ac6ccbc29b16e065f688e_c_1351726314_raw.jpeg) - 3.75/5 - Surprised myself with how much I like this one. Superbly clean and crispy, maybe a touch sweeter than others but tastes great. I miss the Hamms Instagram account

5. [Rolling Rock](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/c1860d79e0d1f99e897db03ecf35c8f3_c_1351725860_raw.jpeg) - 3.75/5 - Crispy, super clean malt, melon rind hop, with great balance. It's delightfully simple and infinitely crushable. Very well executed.

6. [Bud Ice](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/8db71c26e5166caad86c66f9fef24def_c_1351724203_raw.jpeg) - 3.75/5 - I love this label, makes me think of 90s-era ice hockey. Tastes surprisingly good. It's definitely stronger but it's not offensively bold like most other ice beers. Maybe a little more prominent wood flavor smoothing things out aside the crispy clean maltiness. Huge spread across the rankings from Budweiser!

7. [Budweiser](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/19b841c856338a6a0e43a46d129547f2_c_1351723555_raw.jpeg) - 3.5/5 - My late grandfather's beer of choice, because everything else gives you brain cancer. I like it too. Beechwood gives the clean crushable maltiness a smooth woody flavor that I probably wouldn't notice if I wasn't overanalyzing it.

8. [Old Style](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/f8ff28505fa3c2022b602fe45107f3e0_c_1351723127_raw.jpeg) - 3.5/5 - Chicago's favorite. It's maybe a little sweeter than most of the others but brings good body, a deliciously clean maltiness, and a light earthy hop.

9. [Strohs](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/83d58fdfa1969a792c00babda389da78_c_1351722825_raw.jpeg) - 3.5/5 - Formerly brewed in Detroit. Super clean maltiness with a well balanced melony lychee hop thing going on. My dad loves to tell me about his relatives who could drink on the job at the Stroh's factory (but not too much!). Anotehr fun fact - Stroh's spelled backwards is Short's!

10. [Altes](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/52c355dfa1f510a713c81e939fc8421b_c_1351722035_raw.jpeg) - 3.5/5 - Earthy bitter hops and piney sweetness atop a toasted caramel malty base and a crushable body. Maybe crystal malt? Nice hoppy amber vibes. Probably doesn't fit the category all that well, but I'm glad I've tried this Detroit classic.

11. [Michelob Ultra Pure Gold](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/45503b76bfc1b25eecb452b0cfc7fcd3_c_1351721320_raw.jpeg) - 3.5/5 - Better flavor than regular Ultra. Nice clean crispy grainy lagery goodness. I'm thinking that going organic must also meant better ingredients.

12. [Michelob Ultra](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/55dc8cbf5f54a8ca2346adf100cce120_c_1351720724_raw.jpeg) - 3.25/5 - Not bad for a light beer! Crispy and clean, maybe a touch of sweet cereal grains. Ultra light flavor overall, but the flavor that is there is surprisingly decent. It also keeps a consistent flavor as it warms up, which is why it ranks so high on my list.

13. [Pabst Blue Ribbon](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/365b6f4a5eaea49f0a78e66d8d88201f_c_1351719655_raw.jpeg) - 3.25/5 - This is pretty much exactly what I think of when I picture the average American shit lager. Crispy and mostly clean with a little toasted malt and earthy hop, but the ingredients taste cheap overall.

14. [Coors Light](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/faee680671cca497c260ac9ade74e9fa_c_1351719275_raw.jpeg) - 3.25/5 - Coors has their carbonation profile down very well. Nice crispiness without the carbonic acid flavor other light beers have. There is a little clean malt flavor but it's pretty light. Tastes very meh when the carbonation dies down.

15. [Miller Genuine Draft](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/95be8f76debcce5f865763df04b6108f_c_1351718587_raw.jpeg) - 3.25/5 - Awesome label. Beer is fine. Less flavorful than High Life. Maybe a little sweeter and a little more artificial tasting. 

16. [Solid Gold](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/b32158e8c3b5fd3ff073397133ea9ead_c_1351718049_raw.jpeg) - 3.25/5 - Sweet grainy aroma. Tastes a lot less artificial than the typical American lager, not to mention more complex, but its slapped right back down by gross corn flavor.

17. [Michelob Original](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/37294c62e0bc80db186f062634451482_c_1351717581_raw.jpeg) - 3.25/5 - I didn't know this still existed! This is the hoppiest of the bunch, but that's not saying much. A light floral and earthy hop atop a clean yet slightly caramelly maltiness.

18. [Natural Ice](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/0ad145fa017717a8adedfd632b79857d_c_1351717051_raw.jpeg) - 3.25/5 - A little bolder than the average shit lager. A little melony hop and a crispy clean malty base. Some cans have hints of doo doo Natty Daddy flavor. Its inconsistent, just like Natty Daddy, but its usually on the better side

19. [Old Milwaukee Light](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/6c2793b263d1662c5be7f0e82fee28c8_c_1351716320_raw.jpeg) - 3.25/5 - Another light beer that tastes very similar to the original, just a little lighter overall. A little drier too. A rare case of the light beer tasting better than the regular!

20. [Old Milwaukee](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/e58d5fc7f541c57cd089651e9ab1cbf9_c_1351715819_raw.jpeg) - 3.25/5 - Somewhat sweet cereal grains, like off brand Lucky Charms, and a clean finish. This is the only beer of this lineup I had to buy in 30 rack form, but I don't think I'll have a problem smashing through it.

21. [Bud Light](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/3d42b5fba88293261a2f9358c3771f4b_c_1351714982_raw.jpeg) - 3/5 - Light and crisp with a nice clean maltiness. A little more carbonic bite. Not much else to it, which I suppose is the point.

22. [Strohs Light](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/4d47f2fb953dad2fd03cfc14e3bd12ee_c_1351714500_raw.jpeg) - 3/5 - Much lighter and less flavorful than the OG. There's a little carbonic astringency to it, but there's still some good flavor of the OG in there. It gets better as carbonation settles.

23. [Miller Light](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/7b9c4e51c0765995b5dafd0ccf2fe11f_c_1351713607_raw.jpeg) - 3/5 - My first beer! I hated it then, but it's tolerable now. Certainly lighter than their other beers but theres some decent clean malty flavors in there.

24. [Natural Light](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/fee828af2a15a1dcc8d5c7d8d49c4f9c_c_1351712910_raw.jpeg) - 3/5 - Nothing spectacular but it's light, crispy, clean, and inoffensive. I didn't hate drinking it. Although, I once drank this warm on an island with a local hermit, and it was pretty enjoyable that day.

25. [Busch](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/79448458d4a36cef2e92ecfaccb804d1_c_1351711316_raw.jpeg) - 3/5 - Crisp and clean, but leaning hard into light beer territory in terms of flavor (or lack thereof) and abv at 4.3%. Getting a little corn coming through also.

26. [Busch Light](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/c00390b8938369196870eb3be956aed5_c_1351710118_raw.jpeg) - 3/5 - Crisp, clean, and a little corny. Tastes virtually the same as regular Busch, but it's also only 0.2% lighter so what's the point? If anything, it's just a little lighter and a little sweeter.

27. [ICEHOUSE](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/5fe379ccf1ca2498cc1914a8d76ab001_c_1351709617_raw.jpeg) - 2.75/5 - It is certainly bolder than most. A mix of potent grains, slightly caramelly with a surprisingly clean and crushable finish.

28. [Bud Select](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/fa5e3e0f41623b672dc523c7d7e944c8_c_1351709027_raw.jpeg) - 2.75/5 - Crisp clean and light. Just tastes of meh super cheap ingredients. This is the only expired beer in the lineup (by 2 months), but I'm not sure it'd be much better if fresher.

29. [Bud Select 55](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/3890426b9eb6a054dd5ba08f4058198b_c_1351708381_raw.jpeg) - 2.5/5 - Astringent carbonic acid, super light, void of flavor except some light and super cheap malt. Why the need for gross 2.4% 55 calorie beer? Just stop drinking!

30. [Natty Daddy](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/f215c04e174ec59b9edf4fee86dd94db_c_1351707639_raw.jpeg) - 2.5/5 - Definitely stronger than your average shit lager. Not great though. Kind of an off brand honey cereal thing with a little boozy heft. Some cans are okay, but some taste downright awful.

This is bold in ways that do not taste good. Stronger shittier malt flavor and a heavier body. I can't believe so many people choose to drink this.

Overcarbonated and mostly tastes of carbonic acid with some astringent fruit flavor at the end. If it didn't say beer on the can, I would have thought this was a shitty attempt at a White Claw."

Official /r/beer FAQ - Please Check Here Before Posting,21,15xg38q,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/15xg38q/official_rbeer_faq_please_check_here_before/,0,2023-08-22 01:39:54,"**THIS IS NOT INTENDED AS A BEER FAQ.  IT IS ADDRESSING A FEW FREQUENTLY BROUGHT UP TOPICS ON /R/BEER.**

Hi there,

There has been some need for announcements on a few different commonly posted topics.  Since we are limited to two stickied posts, I'm going to use this one as a hub for these issues.  I will be adding to this post as needed, but here's a /r/Beer FAQ to cover these post types.

If you notice people posting these topics, please be polite.  Feel free to link to this post or use the provided links in a response.

This is not an invitation to harass anyone for posting a repeated topic.  Reddit does not do a good job with presenting subreddit announcements, rules, sidebar info, etc.  If posts annoy you and you don't think they belong, please consider downvoting, using a report, sending us a modmail message, hiding the post or simply moving on with your day.  I highly suggest using the ""don't show me submissions after I've downvoted them"" option in old.reddit preferences (this may be broken in the app/resdesign website, but it should be fixed eventually and appear in those preferences as well).

* [How do I ask /r/beer for a beer suggestion?](https://old.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/i0we2n/beer_suggestions_on_rbeer_and_you_so_you_want_to/)
   * Where are you?  What's your general location?   In order to suggest a beer that you should buy, we have to know what beers are available for you to buy.  
   * What do you already drink and like or dislike?  What kinds of flavors are you looking for?
   * What's your budget?   
* [Is this beer safe to drink?  Has it gone bad from age or storage conditions?](https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/zrbeqo/stop_asking_if_your_old_beer_is_ok_to_drink/)
   * Generally speaking, beer does not go bad in a way that will make it dangerous to drink.  This assumes that the beer is stored in a sealed container.  It may taste bad, though
* [Am I drinking too much?  Am I having an allergic reaction to beer or is it otherwise making me sick in some way?](https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/about/rules/)
   * This is covered by the /r/Beer rules (some exceptions may be allowed for more casual or general questions):

>Medical questions will be limited. [/r/Beer](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beer) is the wrong forum for serious medical questions, particularly where there's potential for harm to come as a result of the discussion. Please consult a medical professional for any questions about your own health, not an online beer discussion board.

* [Is Sam Adams Utopias worth the price?](https://old.reddit.com/r/beer/search/?q=utopias&include_over_18=on&restrict_sr=on&t=all&sort=new)  
  * That's ultimately up to you, but please look through the many past posts on the topic.

&#x200B;

I'm trying to hit the more pressing topics first, but I'll look for some good links for other topics (""how do I figure out what kind of beers I like?"", ""what are the best budget beers?"", etc.).

Everyone is welcome to [join the official /r/Beer Discord server](https://discord.gg/MvMVFA4Vu3) if you'd like to discuss anything here or just hang out and chat.

Cheers.

Edit: I'm locking this to comments because I don't want to have the post turn into a place where people ask these questions.  However, feel free to post about any topics or send us suggestions for topics to be added via modmail or Discord chat.

Also, I may use the second announcement slot for a specific post on something like old beer questions, but I'd prefer to keep it open for the weekly No Stupid Questions posts (and possibly others; still working on redoing the scheduled posts and making some better topics)."

I understand how tariffs work. I wanted to share my concern with you all. At the same time, I feel like, though I may be misguided, that beer community has a lot of people who voted for Trump. You know that â€œSomeone I can have a beer with.â€ But then, itâ€™s like WHY. I wouldnâ€™t choose a candidate over beer price only, but we do care about it eh? 

After a long day, sit down and grab a beer. Inflation makes it hard to afford beers. Did beer community fail to speak up more to peer beer drinkers, to protect ourâ€¦.rights to beer?"

I just want to make sure that come December (when I start), I can take off running and begin contacting accounts.  I've started creating a list of prospects, but plan to update that information and put in CRM whenever I make initial contact in Decemeber. However, outside of that I'm a little lost on where to start.

One of the things I had loved about Asheville and WNC was the abundance and diversity of the breweries. Big or small, corporate or quirky - always fun and willing to try new things. Known as ""Beer City"". The destruction from Helene and the water crisis have devastated the beer community from the largest to the smallest.

I heard that some are still trying to operate or are shifting production or are being creative to stay in business. 

How can we support those struggling to keep things flowing? I have mostly drank locally and want to continue to do that. Do some of the smaller breweries have outlets for product so that we can keep them going until better days. Love to know everyone's thoughts. Cheers."

Very, very old looking bottle design; not perfectly cylindrical, but wider and stouter. Bottle maybe had a little bit of embossed text?
The one we found was a dark beer, I want to say oat stout. From the UK. I believe the label said how it was brewed in an old church or at least used the well of an old church/abbey. These details keep turning up Sam Smith but that's not the one. Sam Smith has a cylindrical bottle and the label covers more of it. The fabled beer didn't have the yellow color scheme either. I'm fairly confident it was in fact from the UK and not a Belgian one but perhaps that's memory playing tricks.

Can some explain? Iâ€™ve been questioning my sanity over this. Itâ€™s not every Mexican beer, but they are the ones that foam the most in my experience. "

I am landing on Monday morning in Brussels and was thinking of hopping a train to Bruges right away to spend 2 nights there and then come back to Brussels for 3 nights. I'm taking a train to Frankfurt on Saturday so figured it would be best to do Brussels last. 

Are most places still open in December? Does the weather affect public transportation much? How difficult is it to get out to the Westvleteren cafe via public transportation? Any recommendations for places to visit otherwise are always appreciated as well. My sour tolerance is not what it once was so while I'll probably at least swing by Cantillon I will probably try to stick to the more funky and non-sour side of things.

I come to you with a kind of peculiar question, since you lot seem to be the most knowledgeable with regards to that.
I have a dear friend who can, for allergy reasons, not drink wine in any form. However, she would really like to know what it tastes like/have at least an approximation. I want to help her out. I distinctly remember once drinking a beer called â€œNottinghamâ€ by Kehrwieder Kreativbrauerei from Hamburg â€“ while it definitely did not taste the same as wine, for someone who has never drunk any wine I would say it could be an okay approximation in a more interesting way than drinking, say, single-grape juice.
So my question to you: Did you lot ever have a barleywine that tasted a little bit/as close as possible to actual (red) wine? I would buy a Nottingham, but they do not seem to make it anymore. I am situated in Northern Germany, but for this special friend and project I would be ready to import a beer from anywhere.

Beer Core Memories: Foster's Premium,11,1g96jbv,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1g96jbv/beer_core_memories_fosters_premium/,9,2024-10-22 08:29:42,"Foster's Premium, their green can, is my favorite boomer beer. For whatever reason they have the reputation of being an Australian beer when they're actually English I think. I like they because of the bulky size of their single cans, their good reliable malty tasty which I enjoyed many times while munching on countless Japanese style peanuts, and finally because I have a core memory associated with the beer.

I was during one of my college Summers my Dad flew me out to his apartment in Newcastle for an internship. It was an exciting time, but I was depressed in college and my parent's relationships were at a nadir, I wouldn't know it at the time but they'd eventually divorce.

Case in point it was a sad time in my life. When I finally reached his apartment I was so tired, a heavy, sleep deprived body tiredness. My Dad bought me the beer and brought me some wasabi flavored Japanese peanuts from Switzerland. They tasted amazing and the beer really helped me relax. I remember just sitting in his living room couch enjoying my ""dinner"" just before a nice warm shower. I wasn't watching anything on TV, just catching up with Dad.

  
What core memories have you guys formed with beer?"

My fiancÃ© and his dad used to get a growler and beer for a long time neighbor every Halloween but his dad passed away earlier this year. We donâ€™t know the kind of beer his dad used to buy but we wanted to uphold the old tradition. 

We could ask, but we kind of want it to be a surprise since the tradition kind of fazed out after my father in law moved away and leaving us the house to live in. Also, itâ€™s become a little more rare seeing our neighbor outside and striking up a convo.

So of course this is purely subjective and can be a hit or miss, but Iâ€™m curious, what kind of beer would you suggest for a 70+ Midwestern man?

EDIT: Just thought Iâ€™d add; I know little to nothing about beer so hopefully this isnâ€™t a dumb question. But if itâ€™s not too dumb, any suggestions, whether itâ€™s different brands or types/ingredients, anything would be helpful!

   * *Cans are lighter and easier to recycle, while bottles are heavier and more energy-intensive to produce.*
* **Portability & Convenience**: Cans 5/5, Bottles 2/5
   * *Cans win for outdoor adventures and stack easily, while bottles are heavier and breakable.*
* **Cost**: Cans 4/5, Bottles 2/5

Yet for some reason, whenever I get an â€œOktoberfest styleâ€ beer from an American brewery (micro or macro) they seem to be much darker, looking much closer to an amber or even a red then to a Pilsner or lager. 

Does anyone know why this is? Why arenâ€™t they trying to match the actual Oktoberfest beer as made by the breweries that actually serve it at Oktoberfest??

Butâ€¦ Iâ€™m tired. Iâ€™m tired of thinking about it, running around to get the best one. 

I feel like Iâ€™m easing into my â€œCarlsbergâ€ years. I just want to stock my fridge with a 24 and not overthink it. Iâ€™m ready for a house beer.

The problem is, despite all the craft breweries around, Iâ€™m finding it hard to nail one down that fits my criteria, so Iâ€™m hoping for some help.

Hereâ€™s what I am looking for:
-available in 355cans or even better 341bottles.
-ideally available in bulk and not TOO expensive though that is relative and am willing to pay if needed
-ideally craft beer but Iâ€™m starting to think none will fit this bill so open to â€˜gaspâ€™ macro
-5%abv or less
-available in Ontario - and delivery across Ontario as Iâ€™m in Kingston

So far, Iâ€™ve tried
-Muskoka detour (not as good as it used to be. I had high hopes for this one but nope)
-lug lite (not off the table but not great)
-Muskoka tread lightly (loathed it)
-miller high life (sad to this this one is currently in the lead :()
-miller lite (tied with high life)
-side launch light lager (this one isnâ€™t bad)
-Modelo especial (donâ€™t like the beer but has a little skunk that is nostalgic which I kinda did)
-blood brothers blood light (this is my top beer from the category but get expensive since they donâ€™t sell by the case and need to pay shipping)
-Carlsberg (didnâ€™t try because you canâ€™t get in bottles anywhere around here)


On a side note: I LOATHE that every craft brewery is doing tall boys right now. IMHO if youâ€™re doing a light beer and putting it in tall boys youâ€™re doing it wrong. (I assume this was LCBOâ€™s doing so reckon they deserve the blame). 

Pretty close to just giving up and officially starting my Miller years."

"What would it take for British style ales (Bitters, Milds, and Pales) to become popular in the US again?",27,1g1ohus,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1g1ohus/what_would_it_take_for_british_style_ales_bitters/,58,2024-10-12 07:40:57,"The beer that really kickstarted my love of beer was Fuller's ESB. Before I had that when I was 21, I really only drank craft beers because they were stronger and could give you a good buzz faster (Victory Golden Monkey, Lagunitas Brown Shugga, Weyerbacher Merry Monks, etc). But I started reading around and trying new beers and styles for the fun of it, not just to get drunk. I'll always remember having Fuller's ESB for the first time. I was so amazed by the whole experience of how complex the malts were, how much I loved the fruity esters, and how the herbal hops used really balanced it all out. This was in around 2018-ish, and unfortunately since then so many English ales aren't available anymore. Fuller's ESB is gone. Hobgoblin ruby isn't available near me anymore. The more mass produced examples (which weren't really as good anyway) have also disappeared (red hook ESB, honker's ale etc).   


Last April I had the privelidge of going to NERAX (New England Real Ale Exhibiton) and got to try so many cask ales from the UK and US. I'm 27, but I felt like a baby there with the average age probably being in the mid-to-late 40s. It was fascinating to learn how influential British beer styles and brewing culture were to the early craft beer movement in the US. Now, coming upon a British style at a store or a brewery is extemely uncommon. 

  
My question is this. Right now in the US, lagers are making a huge comeback as people are looking for something drinkable and lower ABV that is sessionable. Why aren't British styles a part of this resurgence? They are often even lower in ABV than many lager styles, and are often much more complex and interesting. From an economic standpoint, I believe they are also cheaper to brew as they do not require extended storage. What gives? What's stopping these amazing styles from becoming more of a staple in the craft beer scene in the US?"

Picture this. Ontario. 1988.

Iâ€™m a 9 year old boy. My dad leaves the room, and I take a sip of his beer. Itâ€™s gross. I hate it. But the taste makes an imprint.

Skunky. A bit vegetal.

I grew up, got into craft beer. IPAs, DIPAs, Imperial Stouts, sours.

All great - but Iâ€™ve still yet to taste that taste that I remember.

The closest was a Pacifico on vacation once. But I canâ€™t get that in Ontario.

The only clue I have is that I know my dad drank Oâ€™keefe at one point. But I canâ€™t get that here.

I imagine itâ€™s a taste found in macro beer? Iâ€™ve tried a couple with no luck. I tried Miller Lite and it had a hint of it in the first sip but then it disappeared.

So, I guess Iâ€™m wondering, what beers should I try that might have that nostalgic, skunky, mildly vegetal 80s dad beer taste? Know what I mean?"

My mom had a regular 12oz bottle of MHL in her fringe for months and didnâ€™t have any other beer so I took it upon myself to drink it and it tasted awful. Wasnâ€™t very bubbly for being the champagne of beers and had an extremely sweet corn syrupy flavor to it. I ended up only drinking half of it and havenâ€™t had it again until this week.

Earlier this week I was dying for a beer and was a day away from payday so I settled for a $1.69 32 oz bottle of Miller Highlife and it was so good I had to go by three more today. Perfect balance of light and flavorful. Easily chuggable and pleasantly sippable.

My question is, has any of you noticed MHL tasting better out of the big bottles as opposed to the standard 12oz variety? Or was the one in my momâ€™s fridge just too old? Iâ€™ve finished all three and have yet to taste that offputting sweet corn syrupy note."

From Burial Brewing: How to support Asheville after Helene,145,1fv9k0w,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1fv9k0w/from_burial_brewing_how_to_support_asheville/,12,2024-10-03 21:49:55,"Hi everybody -

The team at Burial Brewing in Asheville has been feeding the community and directing folks to fundraisers as they recover from the catastrophic flooding of Hurricane Helene (I know others like DSSOLVR are helping, but they're who I follow on Instagram). I emailed them to see if I could donate to them to help them with their efforts, and [as promised](https://old.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1fu4fei/asheville_breweries_devastated_by_helene_flooding/lq2fzz1/), here's the email I received:

---

Good Morning Folks,

I want to start by saying thank you to each of you who reached out to offer support. Itâ€™s been overwhelming to keep up with in the best possible way. Hearing from you is keeping us optimistic and moving forward. Iâ€™d also like to thank you for your patience as we tried to wrap our heads around where and how to direct these offers.

Weâ€™ve spent the past few days sorting through the abundance of information thatâ€™s out there and have settled on the following as a start.

**For those looking to support Asheville and WNC:**

* **Overview** - These three resources below have been the most reliable and all-encompassing that we have found so far:

**For those looking to support Burial Beer Co.:**

* **Overview** - As of Tuesday, October 1st, we have been in contact with 100% of Burial's Asheville Staff. Everyone is safe and accounted for. We're considering ourselves incredibly lucky that our Asheville locations did not sustain any major damage. Unfortunately, many of our friends and neighbors cannot say the same. Our timeline on reopening any Burial AVL locations will largely rely on the city's ability to re-establish a potable and running water supply, which we've heard may take weeks and up to months. That being said, our main focus right now is supplying hot meals, cold water, dry goods, feminine products, gas, and electricity to both our staff and the community.
* **Physical Donations** -
Both our Charlotte and Raleigh Taprooms are accepting donations that will be delivered to our South Slope Asheville Taproom. Additionally, UPS and FedEx have resumed service to Asheville. If you're interested and able to send dry goods, feminine products, or bottled water, our address is:
  * [40 Collier Ave, Asheville, NC 28801](https://www.google.com/maps/search/40+Collier+Ave,+Asheville,+NC+28801?entry=gmail&source=g)
* **Volunteering** -
We are thankful to have the resources on our staff to handle our limited Asheville operations at the moment. For those of you looking to volunteer, we'd like to direct you to: volunteer@buncombecounty.org.
* **Financial Support** -
  * [GoFundMe for Asheville Hospitality Staff](https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-asheville-coworkers-in-recovery-together) - Our Charlotte Taproom Manager, Alissa Gavin, has created a fund that will benefit our AVL Bartenders and Kitchen Employees currently unable to work. 
  * [Charlotte](https://burialbeer.com/pages/charlotte-house-of-relics) & [Raleigh](https://burialbeer.com/pages/raleigh-the-exhibit) Taprooms - Both locations are currently open with standard operations. Come say hi to our teams, enjoy some pours, and take some beer to-go.
  * [Online Shop](https://burialbeer.com/pages/delivery-asheville-pickup) - Our Online Shop for Beer and Merchandise Shipping is active. We're working to catch up on orders received during the storm, as well as the new orders coming in each day. Shipping will likely be a bit slower than you're used to from us, but we will get you the goods as soon as we possibly can.
I know this is a lot, but please let me know if you have any questions. I will do my best to get back to everyone as quickly as possible.


Thank you,
The Burial Beer Co. Team"

> These are the sectors that could be the most impacted by the strike:

> Food and Beverage: The dozen or so U.S. ports affected by the strike import nearly $100 million a month of beverages and vinegar, according to a report from the Washington Post. According to the American Farm Bureau Federation via the Washington Post, 80% of all imported beer, whiskey, scotch and more come through the ports will be impacted by the strike.

> Constellation Brands. The maker of Modelo, is one of the companies that imports the most beer to the U.S., although Constellation may be able to avoid disruptions caused by the port through ground transportation from Mexico. Heineken NV and other European beverage companies may feel more of the strikeâ€™s affects.

The longshoreman strikes on the East Coast may cause the prices on imported beer, wine, and spirits to increase, as well as supply to decrease.  Some of the more popular imported brands like Modelo, Corona, Guinness and Heineken may see price increases and be harder to find.  If you regularly drink imported beer, you may want to stock up in case prices increase."

ColdFire Brewingâ€™s â€œFlavor Policeâ€ â€“ A Rant About Customer Choice and Brewery Elitism,0,1fv2ccb,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1fv2ccb/coldfire_brewings_flavor_police_a_rant_about/,34,2024-10-03 14:36:25,"Iâ€™ve got to say, Iâ€™ve had some great times at ColdFire Brewing Company in Eugene, Oregon. They make solid beer, and Iâ€™ve enjoyed supporting a local spot. But tonight? They really lost me with one of the most pretentious policies Iâ€™ve ever come across in any brewery.

Iâ€™ve been to breweries all over the country and made the same simple request at all of them: half IPA, half cider. I like the sweetness of the cider mixed with the hoppiness of the IPAâ€”itâ€™s a combo that works for me. But apparently, ColdFire doesnâ€™t care what its customers like. When I ordered this, the server told me itâ€™s company policy not to honor requests like this because (Iâ€™m paraphrasing here), the brewers work â€œreally hardâ€ to create flavor profiles, and customers need to â€œhonor that.â€ Yeah, really.

What? I thought I walked into a brewery, not the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld. â€œNo mixed drinks for you!â€ I made that exact comparison to the server, who looked at me like Iâ€™d just insulted their entire family. Seriously, though, the snobby disdain in the response was just off-putting.

And hereâ€™s the thing: Iâ€™ve never had a pub, bar, or brewery deny this simple request, which Iâ€™ve made dozens of times over many years at all kinds of places. But ColdFire? Theyâ€™re so wrapped up in their self-importance that they actually enforce this ridiculous policy, as if theyâ€™re doing us a favor by refusing what we like.

And letâ€™s get one thing straightâ€”denying a customerâ€™s requestâ€”even if it seems a bit weirdâ€”should NEVER be a company policy at a food and beverage establishment or anywhere in the service industry. The customerâ€™s preferences reign supreme, especially over the pride and ego of the chefs or, in this case, the brewers. Customers come to enjoy themselves, not be told their tastes are wrong.

FOOD AND DRINK IS PERSONAL. What tastes good to one person might taste like absolute trash to another. People alter their food and drinks to suit their own tastes all the time. Imagine a steakhouse refusing to give you salt because â€œthe chef seasoned it to perfection,â€ or an ice cream shop rejecting your request for two different flavors because â€œour chef determined those donâ€™t go together.â€ Itâ€™s absurd, right? But here we are.

ColdFire, youâ€™ve officially become one of the most pretentious and out-of-touch establishments in Eugene. Congratulations. Newsflash: customers come to enjoy themselves, not to bow down to some snobby, self-important idea of what â€œshouldâ€ be good. And the fact that Iâ€™ve never had a single other place deny this request? That just makes your policy all the more ridiculous.

So, has anyone else had this experience? Is this really the hill ColdFire wants to die on? Curious to hear if this is a one-off or if other people have noticed a shift in the customer experience here. Also curious if anyone knows the name of the owner(s)."

I tapped a keg of Coors last week with one of those ""Party Pumps."" The tap ended up breaking, so we only got 6-10 beers out of it before it was out for commissionâ€”we did not have another tap on hand. We put it in our basement (which is a bit cooler).

  
Do you think it's safe to tap this upcoming Friday(So the beer would be 14 days tapped)? I'm not as concerned with taste, after all, it is keg beer, more with general safety.

What can i get for them, we're in colorado and they're blue collar.",105,1fsh1pk,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1fsh1pk/not_a_beer_drinker_neighbors_are_and_they_helped/,72,2024-09-30 05:51:11,"I asked what they'd want and they said ""whatever""

I've seen them with a beer in a yellow and black case. I haven't bought beer in like 15 years.

Any recommendations would be helpful.


EDIT: Thank you everyone for the comments. Overwhelming suggestions for Coors Banquet made me decide. They seemed to have been quite content with a large case of that as well as some brownies and cookies. It's Sunday and they had kids over and took 10 minutes out of their evening to help my dumbass move a couch up a flight of stairs that I idiotically thought I could do with just a dolly.

Also, to those wondering what being blue collar has to do with anything. People in different types of jobs prefer different things. I'm not saying either is better or worse, I just know that preferences are more prevalent in different fields. "

Using a c-DGM Gehaltemeter for RTD,1,1fsucz5,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1fsucz5/using_a_cdgm_gehaltemeter_for_rtd/,1,2024-09-30 19:31:14,"Hello Hello, I have a question slightly outside the beer topic, but I know some breweries also produce RTD beverages. The other day, we were canning Cuba Libre, and something happened with the carbonation. Everything was measured using a c-DGM Gehaltemeter Haffmans CO2/O2, calibrated and clean:

* Carbonation in the BBT: 2.71 vol.
* Carbonation inline, at the filler inlet: 2.70 vol.
* Carbonation in the cans (average of 35 cans): 2.14 vol.

The cans were randomly selected from the packaging line and refrigerated until they reached an approximate temperature of 32-33 Â°F.

My question is the following: during the measurement, if I didnâ€™t fully open the flow on the equipment, the temperature didnâ€™t drop enough, showing a higher reading (the liquid was about 33 Â°F, but the equipment read 37 Â°F). For this type of product, where Iâ€™m only measuring CO2, what is the correct procedure? (I've never got this kind of problems with the beer, so, im asking for RTD).  Should I fully open the flow until the measurement stabilizes? If so, why does the pressure drop so much, and consequently the carbonation, when there was no breakout or foaming during filling?

Additionally, could it be that the CO2 loss is happening during filling and not due to incorrect measurement? Since this beverage has no proteins (unlike beer, which does allow CO2 retention), would it be advisable to add some additive to improve foam retention in the liquid? Thanks any comment is welcome!"

So as of last Friday, Iâ€™m now 21!!! To be honest for a second, Iâ€™ve had some beers here or there in the last year at family get togethers and parties with friends.

I want to see whatâ€™s out there in the beer world, try a little bit of everything I suppose! If it helps, the beers Iâ€™ve had so far are as follows:

-Bud Light
-Samuel Adams (Oktoberfest, Winter Lager, Summer Ale)
-Corona 
- Blue Moon

Given the ones I listed, I really enjoyed the Samuel Adams flavors the most. Blue Moon being second place, Corona third, and Bud Light being last. Thatâ€™s not because I donâ€™t like it, it just doesnâ€™t excite my palate much.

I'm a Belgian visiting London soon, so I'm looking for some beer recommendations. This isn't my first visit to London, but it will be the first visit since my ""discovery"" that I like the sweeter brown ales. Those include Rochefort 10, Gouden Carolus Imperial Dark, Chimay Bleu, Gulden Draak Classic, Sint-Bernardus Abt 12 and my absolute favourite : Kasteel Donker. 

I've been doing some research online, and it has lead me to things like milk stout, oatmeal stout, tropical stout and honey beer. I have to admit that I've ignored stout beers due to disliking Guinness. But apparently that's an imperial stout? The guesthouse I'm staying at is above an Irish pub, so I'm assuming they'll have quite a few stouts for me to try.

My current ""list"" of beers to try (or bring with me) consists of only 2 beers atm : Left Hand Nitro Milk Stout and Samuel Smith oatmeal stout. I'd love to expand this list with some other sweet British beers. Doesn't necessarily have to be stout.

After the 16th century, beers began to regularly include this ingredient. For years, only a mixture of herbs and spices was used to slightly alter its flavor, around the 1100s AD.

The nun **Hildegard von Bingen** (1098-1179), in a German monastery, wrote a treatise on the benefits of hops, beer, and the use of hops in it. Based on the fact that sweet drinks were heavily consumed, which led to vision problems and blindness, Hildegard suggested that the bitterness of beer counteracted the overconsumption of such beverages.

Thanks to Hildegard, hops were identified as growing in the chapel of Bavaria and became recognized as a key ingredient in beer. It wasnâ€™t until 1400 that hops reached the Netherlands, and in 1519 it was condemned as a bad herb. Not until the 16th century was it included as a basic ingredient."

Canadian Beer Drinkers: Beware of Imports Brewed Under Contract.,0,1fo36yx,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1fo36yx/canadian_beer_drinkers_beware_of_imports_brewed/,45,2024-09-24 10:25:24,"Miller Lite shouldnâ€™t be that difficult to copy. Yet it tastes like Molson. The Wisconsin Miller Lite has a very distinct pils nose and flavor.

Guinness Extra Stout. Itâ€™s %0.4 weaker than the Irish version. It lacks body, flavor, and is fizzy as if thereâ€™s zero nitro in it. Nitro or not itâ€™s just way more fizzy and empty tasting.

Grolsch. Honestly itâ€™s been awhile since I drank an original. But this is flabby and barely palatable. It should be a little more hop sharp and slightly sea sprayâ€™esque.

The problem here is if youâ€™ve never experienced the originals you either like the under contract versions for what they are or you donâ€™t. And I think that Molson and maybe a little less so Labatt, have always wanted to homogenize and lower the expectations of the beer drinking experience.

Or perhaps this is a result of their vertical integration of procuring grains and hops, combined with their standardized brewing process.

Either way Iâ€™m done with these companies. If you agree contact your local convenience stores and grocery to pressure them to have variety."

I've listed a few I found below: 

- New Belgium Brewing (Colorado, USA):Â This brewery is a pioneer in the sustainable beer movement. They run on 100% wind power, have an impressive water conservation system, and even use a methane-powered co-gen engine to turn waste into energy. Plus, they're a certified B Corporation, which is always good!

- Camden Town Brewery (Camden Town, London):Â Despite supporting the worst team in North London, Camden Town Brewery is dedicated to sustainability, using 100% renewable electricity, recycling brewing waste, and minimising material use in packaging. They also conserve water and collaborate with local farmers and a UK charity to reduce environmental impact.

- Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. (California, USA):Â Known for their zero-waste initiative, Sierra Nevada recycles or reuses nearly 100% of their waste. They've also invested heavily in solar energy and have one of the largest privately-owned solar arrays in the U.S. Their commitment to water conservation and sustainable agriculture is also top-notch.

- To Ã˜l (Copenhagen, Denmark):Â To Ã˜l operates out of a facility they've dubbed ""To Ã˜l City,"" which is all about zero-waste and circular economy principles. They're using local, organic ingredients and innovative packaging solutions that make their operations as sustainable as possible.

What other sustainable breweries do you know of? Before anyone mentions BrewDog, please do look at the shit show that company has become. "

I am in Saigon Vietnam now and grabbed a few Asahis at 7-11 but the moment I took a sip from the first one, I knew something was off.  Not only did it not taste the same, but I have never tasted a beer that tasted like some sort of chemical in my entire life.  It was very pronounced.  I cracked open another one and same thing.  I asked my wife to take a sip and she immediately agreed something is way off.  I then inspected the can and it said this on the side. 

â€œby Shenzhen Tsingtao Beer
Asahi Breweries, Ltd., Tokyoâ€
www.asahisuperdry.com

I assumed it was from Japan, but I guess it is a Chinese brewed one, but why so different and why such an awful chemical taste?  Surely Asahi has quality control?  What could have caused this?  Left in the hot sun?  Did I drink a fake beer?   Has anyone had this experience with other beers?  

Also, unsure if related, but about an hour after having those sips (maybe 2 oz/60ml total) my toes on both my feet suddenly curled up with the most intense cramp I have ever experienced and it took 30 mins of massage and hot water to calm them down. I rarely get cramped toes and never for more than a second or two on one foot so this was a big surprise.  So much so that it has me wondering if that beer was poison in some way?  I looked into causes of extreme toe cramps and the only possible thing that jumped out was poisoning as there was no other cause that rang as even possible.  

Will post on a Vietnam subreddit as maybe the locals have some insights.

My favorite is Colt .45, it's just so smooth and silky, slight sweetness, but still malty, almost like drinking a bowl of cereal. I think the taste is superior to Mickey's, and it hits smoother than Olde English, Steele Reserve, and Cobra; in that it doesn't get you drunk off the second sip.

The price is still cheaper than water, and has a good kick, without making you gag as it doesn't taste like IPAs."

Our lines are cleaned professionally (lol) by a guy every week

My question is the following : can Somebody give me some explanation in re the worldwide hops trend ? What I mean is : what happened ? I remember my earlier youth (I'm 34 now), when I was in my teens, in Chile, and nowhere would You find anything termed Â« IPA Â», or Â« APA Â», nor any Â« special Â» beer, and no beer would have hops flavour. All there was was bottled beers (or canned) which You'd get at shops, and they were just... what I'd call Â« regular Â» beers. No hops.

But then all of a sudden (well, if You can call a decade or couple of decades as Â« sudden Â»), suddenly hops everywhere. And specialty beers, and bars that make their special beers, etc. And it seems to Me that this happened quite all over the world. Again : IPAs, APAs, ales, hops and hops.

Can Somebody explain ?, if there's something to be explained beyond just telling Me Â« it's a trend Â» ?

Beers similar to Guinness Extra Stout?

Anyhow, I was just drinking an Augustiner Festbier on my one weekend home in Munich (Iâ€™m American my wife is from here) and I was wondering what the ranking of the classic six Oktoberfest biers are. I have a pretty good idea of where the six breweriesâ€™ helles beers sit (Augustiner, Hacker Pschorr, Paulaner, HofbrÃ¤u, Spaten, LÃ¶wenbrÃ¤u are how they stack up according to the Germans I know more than or less) but I was a little less than pleased with my Augustiner Fest that I thought perhaps the ranking is different. What are the thoughts here about the OG six festbier and how they stack up against one another? "

I usually donâ€™t really enjoy beer or the taste of alcohol But I always say yes to any drink thatâ€™s offered to me to atleast give it a shot. 

Friend brought over a Dragons Milk and some bourbons after I had a Guinness and sip of some other alcohol earlier that night.  All of them were okay but I just didnâ€™t like the bourbons.  I tried the dragons milk thoughâ€¦btw I wasnâ€™t drunk only maybe slightly floaty. I took one sip and instantlyâ€¦..this was such an AMAZING DRINK. The sweetness and fruitiness and darkerâ€¦idk undertones?? I couldnâ€™t believe my taste buds. Loved every sip of it.  I need this again. 

Canâ€™t remember what kind it was though. Definitely not the crimson. I donâ€™t know if it was the Stout or Triple Mash but I need it again.  I do know for sure it wasnâ€™t the crimson or a flavor like for example Oatmeal.  I got a 4 pack of the stout yesterdayâ€¦.but it doesnâ€™t taste like what I remembered. It wasnâ€™t as sweet or fruity.

Does anyone know what Iâ€™m looking for and can point me in the right direction? I donâ€™t have that friends number so I canâ€™t contact him for it. "

I used to drink Reddâ€™s Apple Ale, but now I donâ€™t even enjoy that.
Iâ€™m not looking to get tanked, Iâ€™m just looking for something nice to sip on after work. 
Iâ€™ve done some online research for about 2 weeks now, and have gone and done a pick your own 6pack from the local store.
The only thing Iâ€™ve liked so far is Angry Orchard cider, and thatâ€™s after letting it go semi-flat. 
I donâ€™t like a heavy or overpowering wheat flavor, Iâ€™m a fan of sour/fruity, but flavor matters to me way more than it probably should. 

Drinks Iâ€™ve tried so far:
Shock Top
Lazy Hiker IPA
Sam Adams Cherry Wheat (smelled great tasted awful)
Angry Orchard (liked)
Heineken (didnâ€™t enjoy, but didnâ€™t hate)

CO2/Keg advice,3,1fgr3vn,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1fgr3vn/co2keg_advice/,4,2024-09-15 00:17:58,"Hello. I am having a problem with my new keg setup and Iâ€™m having trouble finding anyone with a similar issue online. 

I got this set up a month ago. Two sixel kegs in a kegerator hooked up to two taps. I have attached a 5 lb CO2 tank to the kegs. 

For the first week it ran no problems. The pours were foamy but after fiddling with the pressure levels I got it pouring well. Then the CO2 tank ran out with both kegs still about half full. I rubbed soap on all the points of escape and found a leak, applied sealant to it and it stopped leaking there. Hooked up a new tank and it poured well, but less than a week later, same problem. The kegs were empty now, replaced them, hooked up a new tank and couldnâ€™t find another leak. 

This is the part where Iâ€™m not finding anyone with the same issue. I followed some instructions I found online:

1. pressurize the regulator until the low pressure gauge is reading 10 psi

2. close the valve between the regulator and the hose and shut off the tank 

The instructions said the pressure should stay the same. What happened was they stayed the same for two minutes, then quickly increased to 25 psi, before suddenly dropping to zero. I tried this twice and the same thing happened each time. 

This is a full tank of CO2 and when I set everything up normally it is pouring beer out of both taps no issue, but I am confused about why my tanks are going empty so fast. 

Has anyone had an issue like this before? Iâ€™m thinking I may need to replace the regulator? Iâ€™m not sure what other troubleshooting to do and I want advice from people more experienced than me before I spend more money on this thing. 

Thank you. "

I planned on getting some cheap insulated jackets for them and I want to get two containers I can set them in and fill will ice. They'll be inside the venue for the reception.

I see a keg is about 16"" diameter and I'm seeing containers that are a 17.5"" width. Do I need something wider? Taller? What would you recommend? I'm picking them up from a local bar, and the guy said he would keep them in the 40 degree cooler in the back for me with their other kegs, do I even need the insulated jackets?

I'm looking for advice...

I am looking to add 6 new draught keg beer lines to my licensed premesis which I own freehold. Currently there is no celllar and I have no taps.

I have all planning and licensing in order for a new cellar area and 6 lines, the cellar being behind the current bar (under 5 meters from keg to tap in a straight line) I am very capable doing any building out work, drilling walls for trunking, connecting things up ect.

However my knowledge of how to design this system is limited to speaking with equipment suppliers and reading/watching websites/YouTube.

At the moment Im thinking I could have a stab at creating this system, buying and installing the parts myself. However I'm concerned I may hit pitfalls or poorly design it. 

I will not be doing the phyiaical cellar room build or the electrics/cellar cooling myself. I am only considering creating the keg draught system.

Is there any good information/resources/recommend training you can share given the above.

If I'm way off the mark and I'm crazy to even attempt it, please let me know aswell.

Thank you.

Currently at IDV again and have it in front of me. Either something changed in the brewing process, Iâ€™m having a stroke, or theyâ€™re pushing beer out too quickly because this one isnâ€™t great. I feel like Iâ€™m tasting it in the middle of fermentation or something.
Very ethanol-heavy and unpalatable in the finish, I actually made a face on the first sip and I keep going back trying to convince myself Iâ€™m crazy to no avail. I had this beer like 4 days ago to run through my supply from last year and finished the glass in under 20m. This version reminds me of Decaâ€™s beer.

The 6 was fantastic, the 8 tasted young but was drinkable, and the 12 is more than unpalatable. Did something happen? Should I see a doctor?"

PSA for Guinness drinkers: Guinness seems to keep extending their $5 rebate program,100,1fammom,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1fammom/psa_for_guinness_drinkers_guinness_seems_to_keep/,23,2024-09-07 01:43:02,"I've been using this for maybe a year or so now. While it used to be seasonal.... it seems they're currently keeping this going indefinitely as it's now been extended until the end of the year. To me, Guinness is a great session beer that is widely available, but my main complaint has always been that it's just a touch too expensive for what it is. This rebate knocks it down to the $1 per 12oz territory (if you're buying the nitro 8 packs), which is pretty great (it's about $15-16 at my grocery store).

I buy Guinness semi-regularly so I've been taking full advantage. The money is typically venmoed to you in a few days.  I think there's a limit of 4 uses per month per person.

The year of Festbier (In America)?,54,1f9w6ji,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1f9w6ji/the_year_of_festbier_in_america/,51,2024-09-06 03:12:09,"Just checking out my local total wine and their OFest selections, after having the hardest time last year finding any festbier (literally just one single variety) this year I count at least 6. Sierra Nevadaâ€™s selection this year is a festbier as well. Is this the year it finally makes it big in America alongside the traditional MÃ¤rzen?

For the unaware, there are two styles of German Oktoberfest bier. In America, we generally only see the older style called MÃ¤rzen, which is an amber very malty style that was traditionally aged half a year (hence the name. Most is not aged nowadays and the flavor is achieved via other means though some still age theirs). 

The more modern variant is known as festbier and is somewhere in between a MÃ¤rzen and a standard helles lager. Malty, slightly hoppy, easy drinking with a surprising kick of alcohol. It was generally very hard to find in the US outside of certain imports, compared to MÃ¤rzen. "

Let's define commonly as being able to reliably find a pub with real ale in any city. Real ale is defined as ""Beer brewed from traditional ingredients, matured by secondary fermentation in the container from which it is dispensed, and served without the use of extraneous carbon dioxide."" by Wiktionary.

The reason why I ask is that I love bitter but will probably have to leave the UK for some years at least to pursue a career in academia.

Edit: some confusion about real ale vs ale. Real ale is a subset of ale. It has been pointed out to me that a better word to use might be cask beer. I'm not asking where you can get any ale because Guinness is ubiquitous but not what I want."

Well to me it had a strong aroma of alcohol, maybe like a port wine,  it looked like used motor oil in the glass.  It had left some funky brown deposits on the blue glass bottle.  I tried it and immediately thought of a port wine that is starting to turn, I would drink it in small quantities.  Maybe a addition to some winter cocktail creation.  The wife's reaction is a bit more intense, I really wish I could post a photo of the face she made.  The works out her mouth were ""yuck, rancid, how the hell can you drink that"".

My next thought was to try a triple bock spriz.  presico,  triple bock and club soda. Maybe that would help.

Maybe as a base or beer bread?

He will only drink Boddingtons and Belhaven Scottish Ale/Belhaven Black Stout now, with the occasional FORGD Stout or Guinness Draught at the bar or when a restaurant wonâ€™t let you BYO.

If not, how would I go about importing it? Itâ€™s for personal use, obviously, but would I need a permit or documents for it?

Iâ€™ve been sampling cask ales around town (Stockholm) and so far been let down. Right now Iâ€™m trying Timothy Taylorâ€™s Boltmaker (tried Knowle Spring Blonde too) from a reputable bar (it has the â€œCask Marqueâ€ certification and a Timothy Taylor Champion Club plaque)

To me, the beer is slightly too warm (not cold enough), slightly too flat, and lacking anything that stands out flavor wise. I get that the point is for it to be this way, but the only substance Iâ€™m getting is a tea like astringency. A little dusty. 

The only one Iâ€™ve liked decent was a darker mild; it felt more appropriate for a darker beer, creamier, smooth. 

I respect these bars so maybe itâ€™s just a me thing. I havenâ€™t traveled to the UK and wonâ€™t give up yet. But for now Iâ€™d prefer the beer on normal draft. "

Ale Lager Hybrid available in Chicago? Pretty new to beer ðŸº ,1,1ey8unf,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1ey8unf/ale_lager_hybrid_available_in_chicago_pretty_new/,26,2024-08-22 10:00:31,"
Hello, 
Looking for a gift for my family. One guy likes a lager and the other prefers and Ale type of beer. Does anyone have good recommendations for a hybrid Ale/Lager? Iâ€™ve been looking but still relatively new to drinking. Iâ€™ve tried a Goose island IPA and definitely did not like it, other than that I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve tried a â€œtrueâ€ ale, so does this sub have good general information on beer? 

I live in Chicago and budget is unlimited. Just looking for a solid drink. 

Thanks again for your time!!! ðŸ™‚"

I never really got into beer until I visited Munich in 2015. Since then, Hefeweizens have been my go to beers. I've tried several, and here is my take.

Weihenstephan - this is the one where I notice variations from batch to batch, so it's a bit or miss for me. I've noticed that some have a stronger note of clove, and I really don't like them. The ones I've gotten that had strong banana note, I think are the best I've had. But again, it's inconsistent in my opinion, so it's not my go to.

KÃ¶nig Ludwig Weissbier- it's been a few years since I've had it, so I can't really comment on specifics, but I know that it's probably almost my favorite or at least top 3

Franziskaner- I don't think it's quite as good as the  best weihenstephans or Ludwig's ive had, but it's very consistent, and (at least for me) easy to find. I'd describe this one as a more bready taste.

I had some of the Hofbrau Hefeweizen last week, it was pretty good, but seemed a bit more bitter than other Hefeweizens.

Ive probably tried the Hefeweizens from most or all of the Munich breweries, but none of them were memorable enough for me to comment on or good enough for me to have continue purchasing.

What are your favorite Hefeweizens?"

El Guapo has a translucent, burnt-orange appearance, with a thin, off-white head and a bit of lacing. The aroma is of rich, dark bread crust and a possible agave touch. The flavor is of white bread crust and noticeable and unusual bitterness. El Guapo has a medium body and a mostly-dry finish."

I know some breweries will print a can date vs an expiration date, but after a quick search apparently Goose Island prints expiration dates. So I went back to the store and showed them the date on the box, and they told me I was wrong and that was the can date, and the expiration date was the one next to it. The serial code. If that were the case it would have expired on December 9th, 2002 even though it was canned on June 24th, 2024. Apparently they think beer retro-expires and they wouldnâ€™t have it, and not wanting to start an argument, I just took it and left. Even if it was December 2024, I would think hop character would significantly degrade in that amount of time.

There are always those people at the bar that add a pinch of salt to ""enhance"" flavors or to make it less flat - IMO I'm not a fan.

Just with a quick google search, [Guinness Nitrosurge | Official Global Site](https://nitrosurge.guinness.com/en/), seems to have a device for specialty beer cans. However, you have to use special cans that are not sold in the US. IMO their US canned beer is nothing like what you get in Ireland, so if this works it would be revolutionary.

Then there are also the machines (like [Amazon.com : Chill-O-Matic Instant Beverage Cooler. You can Chill a 12 Ounce Can of Beer or Soda in just 60 Seconds with This Portable Cooling Device : Home & Kitchen](https://www.amazon.com/Chill-Matic-Automatic-Beverage-Chiller/dp/B01DFPM5PE?th=1)) that get your beer ice cold. This maybe a bigger deal for light beer.

This leads to canned Hazy IPA. These are really impacted by the time they sit on a shelf. I was wondering with the beer expects on this sub: is there are any other ways to make these canned beers taste more consistent?

Other than those above and besides tapping a keg, is there anything I'm missing?"

Craft breweries need more flagship beers.,21,1escvip,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1escvip/craft_breweries_need_more_flagship_beers/,17,2024-08-15 04:11:29,"I am constantly frustrated with many established craft breweries in my region (NYC area) rotating almost their entire selection every couple of months. The new project is always a gamble. If it's a hit, I won't be able to find it in two months. If it's a dud, it's not fun to pay $11 for the new high ABV hazy. I find myself preferring breweries distributing the flagship beer they've perfected with a couple projects I can try as well. Not every beer drinking experience needs to be a project.

My drinking buddy disagrees with me. He claims this is part of the fun of drinking craft beer and, with many of these breweries, their reputation precedes them and it's worth the gamble. I'm curious where everyone else stands on this? "

I bought variety packs, went to breweries and got flights, bought all kinds of beers from stores and gas stations and I enjoyed them a lot.

We want alcohol at our wedding, but figured we either need to have a ticketing system (yuck) or stick to beer and wine (better). We do have a bartender, but the venue does not supply any alcohol.

I suppose my questions are these:

1. Is there a better approach?
2. If not, we figured \~20-30 bottles of wine for \~150 people. How many cans of beer should we get?
3. (not really a beer drinker) What types of beer should we get? 2-4 different types?
4. Are seltzers a good compromise?

Here's a canning line."" You know the drill. 

I'll be traveling to Denver in a few weeks and was hoping someone had experience with a truly great/unique brewery tour in the area. I have been to Denver once as an adult. Only drank at a couple of places and toured O'Dell in Ft. Collins. I tend to drink with the season (more pales in the summer, stouts in the winter), but am an equal opportunity embiber.

Boy were we wrong.

Almost every pub we visited in London and Edinburgh had multiple options. Most times each new pub would have one or two she hadn't seen yet. On top of that, some places had a non-alcoholic on draught which she was incredibly excited to see (I think it was Lucky Saint that was on draft the few times we saw this).

This allowed her to pub crawl with me and have as much fun with it as I did.

It was really impressive to see how many options there were. Hopefully we see those types of options here in the states soon, especially a draught option here and there."

Sweet or minimally bitter beers?,5,1eioa5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1eioa5p/sweet_or_minimally_bitter_beers/,25,2024-08-03 06:17:14,"It's possible I'll never actually like any beers, but I find I'm very adverse to the kind of bitterness I taste in beers. I like dark chocolate a lot, coffee I tend to add a generous amount of cream and sugar to, and more often than not liquors with a lot of botanicals like gin are enjoyable. So it's not a sweeping dislike of bitterness. Are there any beers that I can look into trying that are not strongly bitter, or perhaps slightly sweet instead of bitter?"

I really want to make a shandy at home similar to what you get in a pun but I am not sure what beer/lager they actually use in a pub.

So far I have been using Coors with lemonade as that is all they had available whilst I was on holiday, but I have became a bit too prone to the taste of Coors now and the lemonade just overpowers it. It is no longer giving me that refreshing taste!

What do you use/recommend?

It was brewed specially for canning in the 60s-80s in the UK, it apparently called itself a pale ale but on further inspection of old inactive beer forums it sounds like it was a sweetish lager brewed with Hallertau hops so sounds more like a German Helles, but Iâ€™m guessing this probably wouldnâ€™t taste similar. Hard to know having never tried the original. Weâ€™ve tried him on a few modern pale ales, even simpler less hoppy ones and theyâ€™re not the taste heâ€™s after.  

Does anyone know of anything that would fit the bill I could buy in the UK (London ish), that isnâ€™t Budweiser, thatâ€™s been suggested previously by friends, but heâ€™s not a fan.

I live in NY so most of the beers in the NY, PA area we've gotten our hands on but short of taking some road trips some of these seems pretty hard to come by since shipping beer seems to be a limited option at best.

Is Miller Lite a â€œredneckâ€ beer?,0,1ed9xvj,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1ed9xvj/is_miller_lite_a_redneck_beer/,45,2024-07-27 13:38:07,"hello all, this is a question for our American beer lovers on this forum.

Iâ€™m sitting here in Melbourne (Australia ) enjoying a few Miller Lite. 

This is a special occasion for us as this beer is not available here. A mate brought it over after a trip to the USA. We rarely have access to it.

Itâ€™s a special beer for us because we had an absolutely phenomenal week in Las Vegas to celebrate turning forty (eight years ago now). Many miller lite were drunk during that trip. 

Iâ€™ve been told by one of our mates that Miller Lite is considered a â€œredneck beerâ€ in the US. In fact when he was sitting on the verandah enjoying a miller lite in his last trip to the US (Washington) with his family there he was told â€œall we need is a pickup truck and a confederate flagâ€

Is miller lite a redneck beer?"

Iâ€™m not fully familiar with this method of stillage and donâ€™t fully trust the advice Iâ€™ve been given.

My question is: After releasing the valve on the cask to allow the secondary fermentation to take place, and having left the valve open for 48hrs, can I close the valve again and halt the secondary fermentation until the beer is ready to dispense, or does it need to be dispensed immediately after the 48hr secondary fermentation has taken place?"

I've been drinking (good) lager most of the time lately, and have been thinking about how I've never had a shit lager phase. I drank mostly fruity vodka drinks and Crown Royal in college, and when I turned 21, I discovered the craft beer section at the grocery store and went from there. Then I started thinking, I should put together a shitty lager tasting and torture my friends! Now I've finally done it.
   
There are a lot of beers in this category, so I limited myself to 33, all American, including a handful of Michigan brewed and regional options. Most of these beers were within recommended freshness. 

We first sampled all 33 beers in one night. Getting through it all was a struggle. Trying so many similarly tasting beers in one night is *very* mentally exhausting, not to mention the exhaustion of excessive drinking. Yet, at the very end, the #1 beer was unanimously decided, and everyone's top 5 was pretty damn close. For the 4 months after the tasting, I drank several more of each to fine tune my ratings and comments. I drank them grouped by brewery, I've drank them worst to best, and I've done more side-by-sides than I can count. I questioned why I was laboring so hard over this pointless ranking... but I had to keep on going.
   
Perhaps the most eye-opening part of all this was how profoundly shitty it made me feel. The hangover made me feel so remarkably disgusting, considerably more so than craft beer ever has, and in a qualitatively different way. I'm thinking it's the dog food grade ingredients used in these shitty lagers. I hope to never feel that way again.

Anyways... on to the ranking!

#[The Killshot](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/3e3a9798fba856c2c497652d7fba5b77_c_1351703492_raw.jpeg)
    
1. [High Life](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/6a19a589b975bfbd571abcf0e4e26d0b_c_1351728906_raw.jpeg) - 4/5 - The champagne of beers is unanimous winner of the 33 shit lager showdown. Wonderfully balanced, flavorful, and clean maltiness with a well balanced hop note. This truly sets the standard for American macro lager.

2. [Pabst Blue Ribbon Extra](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/6fe817048ac162db1a589cc8fea60438_c_1351727722_raw.jpeg) - 4/5 - I am surprised by how good this is compared to regular PBR. It's bolder but tastes like better quality ingredients too. There's a bit of a spicy earthy toasty hop thing, and a more substantial maltiness and body. Great stuff! It's also the only mass market lager I found packaged using the plastic PakTech can carriers.

3. [Coors Banquet](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/7b4e5174d56b143c9a2a136b842f2154_c_1351726697_raw.jpeg) - 4/5 - Easily top 3 American shit lagers. Super clean crispy malts, light balanced hops, a touch of sweetness, and an almost creamy carbonation profile. It just tastes good.

4. [Hamms](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/86fd4815d92ac6ccbc29b16e065f688e_c_1351726314_raw.jpeg) - 3.75/5 - Surprised myself with how much I like this one. Superbly clean and crispy, maybe a touch sweeter than others but tastes great. I miss the Hamms Instagram account

5. [Rolling Rock](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/c1860d79e0d1f99e897db03ecf35c8f3_c_1351725860_raw.jpeg) - 3.75/5 - Crispy, super clean malt, melon rind hop, with great balance. It's delightfully simple and infinitely crushable. Very well executed.

6. [Bud Ice](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/8db71c26e5166caad86c66f9fef24def_c_1351724203_raw.jpeg) - 3.75/5 - I love this label, makes me think of 90s-era ice hockey. Tastes surprisingly good. It's definitely stronger but it's not offensively bold like most other ice beers. Maybe a little more prominent wood flavor smoothing things out aside the crispy clean maltiness. Huge spread across the rankings from Budweiser!

7. [Budweiser](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/19b841c856338a6a0e43a46d129547f2_c_1351723555_raw.jpeg) - 3.5/5 - My late grandfather's beer of choice, because everything else gives you brain cancer. I like it too. Beechwood gives the clean crushable maltiness a smooth woody flavor that I probably wouldn't notice if I wasn't overanalyzing it.

8. [Old Style](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/f8ff28505fa3c2022b602fe45107f3e0_c_1351723127_raw.jpeg) - 3.5/5 - Chicago's favorite. It's maybe a little sweeter than most of the others but brings good body, a deliciously clean maltiness, and a light earthy hop.

9. [Strohs](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/83d58fdfa1969a792c00babda389da78_c_1351722825_raw.jpeg) - 3.5/5 - Formerly brewed in Detroit. Super clean maltiness with a well balanced melony lychee hop thing going on. My dad loves to tell me about his relatives who could drink on the job at the Stroh's factory (but not too much!). Anotehr fun fact - Stroh's spelled backwards is Short's!

10. [Altes](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/52c355dfa1f510a713c81e939fc8421b_c_1351722035_raw.jpeg) - 3.5/5 - Earthy bitter hops and piney sweetness atop a toasted caramel malty base and a crushable body. Maybe crystal malt? Nice hoppy amber vibes. Probably doesn't fit the category all that well, but I'm glad I've tried this Detroit classic.

11. [Michelob Ultra Pure Gold](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/45503b76bfc1b25eecb452b0cfc7fcd3_c_1351721320_raw.jpeg) - 3.5/5 - Better flavor than regular Ultra. Nice clean crispy grainy lagery goodness. I'm thinking that going organic must also meant better ingredients.

12. [Michelob Ultra](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/55dc8cbf5f54a8ca2346adf100cce120_c_1351720724_raw.jpeg) - 3.25/5 - Not bad for a light beer! Crispy and clean, maybe a touch of sweet cereal grains. Ultra light flavor overall, but the flavor that is there is surprisingly decent. It also keeps a consistent flavor as it warms up, which is why it ranks so high on my list.

13. [Pabst Blue Ribbon](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/365b6f4a5eaea49f0a78e66d8d88201f_c_1351719655_raw.jpeg) - 3.25/5 - This is pretty much exactly what I think of when I picture the average American shit lager. Crispy and mostly clean with a little toasted malt and earthy hop, but the ingredients taste cheap overall.

14. [Coors Light](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/faee680671cca497c260ac9ade74e9fa_c_1351719275_raw.jpeg) - 3.25/5 - Coors has their carbonation profile down very well. Nice crispiness without the carbonic acid flavor other light beers have. There is a little clean malt flavor but it's pretty light. Tastes very meh when the carbonation dies down.

15. [Miller Genuine Draft](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/95be8f76debcce5f865763df04b6108f_c_1351718587_raw.jpeg) - 3.25/5 - Awesome label. Beer is fine. Less flavorful than High Life. Maybe a little sweeter and a little more artificial tasting. 

16. [Solid Gold](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/b32158e8c3b5fd3ff073397133ea9ead_c_1351718049_raw.jpeg) - 3.25/5 - Sweet grainy aroma. Tastes a lot less artificial than the typical American lager, not to mention more complex, but its slapped right back down by gross corn flavor.

17. [Michelob Original](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/37294c62e0bc80db186f062634451482_c_1351717581_raw.jpeg) - 3.25/5 - I didn't know this still existed! This is the hoppiest of the bunch, but that's not saying much. A light floral and earthy hop atop a clean yet slightly caramelly maltiness.

18. [Natural Ice](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/0ad145fa017717a8adedfd632b79857d_c_1351717051_raw.jpeg) - 3.25/5 - A little bolder than the average shit lager. A little melony hop and a crispy clean malty base. Some cans have hints of doo doo Natty Daddy flavor. Its inconsistent, just like Natty Daddy, but its usually on the better side

19. [Old Milwaukee Light](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/6c2793b263d1662c5be7f0e82fee28c8_c_1351716320_raw.jpeg) - 3.25/5 - Another light beer that tastes very similar to the original, just a little lighter overall. A little drier too. A rare case of the light beer tasting better than the regular!

20. [Old Milwaukee](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/e58d5fc7f541c57cd089651e9ab1cbf9_c_1351715819_raw.jpeg) - 3.25/5 - Somewhat sweet cereal grains, like off brand Lucky Charms, and a clean finish. This is the only beer of this lineup I had to buy in 30 rack form, but I don't think I'll have a problem smashing through it.

21. [Bud Light](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/3d42b5fba88293261a2f9358c3771f4b_c_1351714982_raw.jpeg) - 3/5 - Light and crisp with a nice clean maltiness. A little more carbonic bite. Not much else to it, which I suppose is the point.

22. [Strohs Light](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/4d47f2fb953dad2fd03cfc14e3bd12ee_c_1351714500_raw.jpeg) - 3/5 - Much lighter and less flavorful than the OG. There's a little carbonic astringency to it, but there's still some good flavor of the OG in there. It gets better as carbonation settles.

23. [Miller Light](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/7b9c4e51c0765995b5dafd0ccf2fe11f_c_1351713607_raw.jpeg) - 3/5 - My first beer! I hated it then, but it's tolerable now. Certainly lighter than their other beers but theres some decent clean malty flavors in there.

24. [Natural Light](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/fee828af2a15a1dcc8d5c7d8d49c4f9c_c_1351712910_raw.jpeg) - 3/5 - Nothing spectacular but it's light, crispy, clean, and inoffensive. I didn't hate drinking it. Although, I once drank this warm on an island with a local hermit, and it was pretty enjoyable that day.

25. [Busch](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/79448458d4a36cef2e92ecfaccb804d1_c_1351711316_raw.jpeg) - 3/5 - Crisp and clean, but leaning hard into light beer territory in terms of flavor (or lack thereof) and abv at 4.3%. Getting a little corn coming through also.

26. [Busch Light](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/c00390b8938369196870eb3be956aed5_c_1351710118_raw.jpeg) - 3/5 - Crisp, clean, and a little corny. Tastes virtually the same as regular Busch, but it's also only 0.2% lighter so what's the point? If anything, it's just a little lighter and a little sweeter.

27. [ICEHOUSE](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/5fe379ccf1ca2498cc1914a8d76ab001_c_1351709617_raw.jpeg) - 2.75/5 - It is certainly bolder than most. A mix of potent grains, slightly caramelly with a surprisingly clean and crushable finish.

28. [Bud Select](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/fa5e3e0f41623b672dc523c7d7e944c8_c_1351709027_raw.jpeg) - 2.75/5 - Crisp clean and light. Just tastes of meh super cheap ingredients. This is the only expired beer in the lineup (by 2 months), but I'm not sure it'd be much better if fresher.

29. [Bud Select 55](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/3890426b9eb6a054dd5ba08f4058198b_c_1351708381_raw.jpeg) - 2.5/5 - Astringent carbonic acid, super light, void of flavor except some light and super cheap malt. Why the need for gross 2.4% 55 calorie beer? Just stop drinking!

Kind of an off brand honey cereal thing with a little boozy heft. Some cans are okay, but some taste downright awful.

31. [Bud Light Platinum](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/c3a3200af4ccc8d526cb055746201f30_c_1351706335_raw.jpeg) - 2.5/5 - Why is a Bud Light variant their stronger than Bud Ice? This is bold in ways that do not taste good. Stronger shittier malt flavor and a heavier body. I can't believe so many people choose to drink this.

32. [Schlitz](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/98ae15d3804cfe7b06685a6ebca93429_c_1351704991_raw.jpeg) - 2.25/5 - Tastes like cheap sweet cereal grains, kind of a shitty caramel thing, and a little bitterness. It's gross.

33. [Bud Light Next](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/62b5e6155d25220a60231152dcd30a15_c_1351704172_raw.jpeg) - 1.5/5 - This is truly awful. Overcarbonated and mostly tastes of carbonic acid with some astringent fruit flavor at the end. If it didn't say beer on the can, I would have thought this was a shitty attempt at a White Claw."

Official /r/beer FAQ - Please Check Here Before Posting,18,15xg38q,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/15xg38q/official_rbeer_faq_please_check_here_before/,0,2023-08-22 01:39:54,"**THIS IS NOT INTENDED AS A BEER FAQ.  IT IS ADDRESSING A FEW FREQUENTLY BROUGHT UP TOPICS ON /R/BEER.**

Hi there,

There has been some need for announcements on a few different commonly posted topics.  Since we are limited to two stickied posts, I'm going to use this one as a hub for these issues.  I will be adding to this post as needed, but here's a /r/Beer FAQ to cover these post types.

If you notice people posting these topics, please be polite.  Feel free to link to this post or use the provided links in a response.

This is not an invitation to harass anyone for posting a repeated topic.  Reddit does not do a good job with presenting subreddit announcements, rules, sidebar info, etc.  If posts annoy you and you don't think they belong, please consider downvoting, using a report, sending us a modmail message, hiding the post or simply moving on with your day.  I highly suggest using the ""don't show me submissions after I've downvoted them"" option in old.reddit preferences (this may be broken in the app/resdesign website, but it should be fixed eventually and appear in those preferences as well).

* [How do I ask /r/beer for a beer suggestion?](https://old.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/i0we2n/beer_suggestions_on_rbeer_and_you_so_you_want_to/)
   * Where are you?  What's your general location?   In order to suggest a beer that you should buy, we have to know what beers are available for you to buy.  
   * What do you already drink and like or dislike?  What kinds of flavors are you looking for?
   * What's your budget?   
* [Is this beer safe to drink?  Has it gone bad from age or storage conditions?](https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/zrbeqo/stop_asking_if_your_old_beer_is_ok_to_drink/)
   * Generally speaking, beer does not go bad in a way that will make it dangerous to drink.  This assumes that the beer is stored in a sealed container.  It may taste bad, though
* [Am I drinking too much?  Am I having an allergic reaction to beer or is it otherwise making me sick in some way?](https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/about/rules/)
   * This is covered by the /r/Beer rules (some exceptions may be allowed for more casual or general questions):

>Medical questions will be limited. [/r/Beer](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beer) is the wrong forum for serious medical questions, particularly where there's potential for harm to come as a result of the discussion. Please consult a medical professional for any questions about your own health, not an online beer discussion board.

* [Is Sam Adams Utopias worth the price?](https://old.reddit.com/r/beer/search/?q=utopias&include_over_18=on&restrict_sr=on&t=all&sort=new)  
  * That's ultimately up to you, but please look through the many past posts on the topic.

&#x200B;

I'm trying to hit the more pressing topics first, but I'll look for some good links for other topics (""how do I figure out what kind of beers I like?"", ""what are the best budget beers?"", etc.).

Everyone is welcome to [join the official /r/Beer Discord server](https://discord.gg/MvMVFA4Vu3) if you'd like to discuss anything here or just hang out and chat.

Cheers.

Edit: I'm locking this to comments because I don't want to have the post turn into a place where people ask these questions.  However, feel free to post about any topics or send us suggestions for topics to be added via modmail or Discord chat.

Also, I may use the second announcement slot for a specific post on something like old beer questions, but I'd prefer to keep it open for the weekly No Stupid Questions posts (and possibly others; still working on redoing the scheduled posts and making some better topics)."

Pilsner Urquell,61,1gpsi3n,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1gpsi3n/pilsner_urquell/,44,2024-11-13 02:03:39,"The best commercially available beer in Europe (Eastern) imo. I am a big fan of Czech and Slovak beers, the more bitter the better. 

Itâ€™s a bit more costly, 1,30â‚¬ for a can - compared to like a good one (personal opinion) Kozel which costs 0,90 a can- but absolutely worth it.

Itâ€™s the best Pilsner ever, change my mind. I have gone through all Czech or Slovak beers, let it be Kozel, Radegast, Gambrinus etcâ€¦ which are all good, this is in the top 3 for me, coming second to Guiness. Itâ€™s smooth, a bit more watery than a Gambrinus but it has a light body with no aftertaste. It has everything I need in a beer. 

Sorry for the rant, but after some time I bought a six a pack again and I canâ€™t believe itâ€™s gone in 1,5 hours hahahah, but everyoneâ€™s opinion is different. 

So whatâ€™s ur opinion? Do you like Pilsners? Have u ever had Czech beer? "
Shipping beer from NY to UK,4,1gpzwch,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1gpzwch/shipping_beer_from_ny_to_uk/,2,2024-11-13 07:20:21,"Hey all! So long story short the brewery I work at here in NY has built a relationship with a professional soccer club in the UK including making licensed beers for them.

They would love to get their hands on some of the beer for their ill father to try and we're trying to see how we can logistically get a 4-pack or two over to them. We're ok with a bit of cost within reason considering shipping will likely be ridiculous.

One of the things I had loved about Asheville and WNC was the abundance and diversity of the breweries. Big or small, corporate or quirky - always fun and willing to try new things. Known as ""Beer City"". The destruction from Helene and the water crisis have devastated the beer community from the largest to the smallest.

I heard that some are still trying to operate or are shifting production or are being creative to stay in business. 

How can we support those struggling to keep things flowing? I have mostly drank locally and want to continue to do that. Do some of the smaller breweries have outlets for product so that we can keep them going until better days. Love to know everyone's thoughts. Cheers."

Trying to remember/find UK stout in a very old style bottle,12,1ghkufo,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1ghkufo/trying_to_rememberfind_uk_stout_in_a_very_old/,6,2024-11-02 07:57:07,"My friend and I absolutely cherished this one beer we used to find at a chain called Earth Fare in the States about a decade ago. Neither of us can remember the name or evidently [correct] enough details to turn it up online. Hoping someone will know what I'm talking about so my friend and I can hopefully find it and enjoy it again.

Very, very old looking bottle design; not perfectly cylindrical, but wider and stouter. Bottle maybe had a little bit of embossed text?
The one we found was a dark beer, I want to say oat stout. From the UK. I believe the label said how it was brewed in an old church or at least used the well of an old church/abbey. These details keep turning up Sam Smith but that's not the one. Sam Smith has a cylindrical bottle and the label covers more of it. The fabled beer didn't have the yellow color scheme either. I'm fairly confident it was in fact from the UK and not a Belgian one but perhaps that's memory playing tricks.

Hoping that rings a bell to someone because I'd kill to find it again, or at least know what it was. Thank you!"

I am landing on Monday morning in Brussels and was thinking of hopping a train to Bruges right away to spend 2 nights there and then come back to Brussels for 3 nights. I'm taking a train to Frankfurt on Saturday so figured it would be best to do Brussels last. 

Are most places still open in December? Does the weather affect public transportation much? How difficult is it to get out to the Westvleteren cafe via public transportation? Any recommendations for places to visit otherwise are always appreciated as well. My sour tolerance is not what it once was so while I'll probably at least swing by Cantillon I will probably try to stick to the more funky and non-sour side of things.

I distinctly remember once drinking a beer called â€œNottinghamâ€ by Kehrwieder Kreativbrauerei from Hamburg â€“ while it definitely did not taste the same as wine, for someone who has never drunk any wine I would say it could be an okay approximation in a more interesting way than drinking, say, single-grape juice.

I noticed today an odd ""Soy sauce"" like odor only to find the three beers sitting in a pool of brown liquid. Beers were unopened on the top but must of had a small burst at the bottom since one can was half empty, and one was lighter than a full one. 

I dont really have the fridge space, but should i be chilling all my IPAs? Ive had sours explode and know to fridge those, but never knew IPAs could as well.

You learn and move on i guess lol"

I found Tiny Rebel beers for example, but not the specific ones I had on my list. In Sainsbury's, there were 2 beers that I couldn't buy without buying the entire multi-pack. Which I'm always hesitant to do when I'm unsure whether I'll actually like it.

I bought the following :

* Fuller's London Pride
* McEwans Champion (didn't find Export)
* Shepherd Neame Bishops Finger (didn't find 1698 Old Ale)
* Brewdog Shore Leave
* Hobgoblin Ruby
* Timothy Taylor's Landlord (couldn't find Dark Landlord)
* The Kernel Export Stout 1890
* Tynt Meadow (really curious about that one!)
* Cerberus 2022 Imperial Stout
* Elusive Brewing Mince Pie Barley Wine
* Yonder Rocky Road Pastry Stout
* Tartarus Moon Rabbit

For whatever reason they have the reputation of being an Australian beer when they're actually English I think. I like they because of the bulky size of their single cans, their good reliable malty tasty which I enjoyed many times while munching on countless Japanese style peanuts, and finally because I have a core memory associated with the beer.

I was during one of my college Summers my Dad flew me out to his apartment in Newcastle for an internship. It was an exciting time, but I was depressed in college and my parent's relationships were at a nadir, I wouldn't know it at the time but they'd eventually divorce.

Case in point it was a sad time in my life. When I finally reached his apartment I was so tired, a heavy, sleep deprived body tiredness. My Dad bought me the beer and brought me some wasabi flavored Japanese peanuts from Switzerland. They tasted amazing and the beer really helped me relax. I remember just sitting in his living room couch enjoying my ""dinner"" just before a nice warm shower. I wasn't watching anything on TV, just catching up with Dad.

We could ask, but we kind of want it to be a surprise since the tradition kind of fazed out after my father in law moved away and leaving us the house to live in. Also, itâ€™s become a little more rare seeing our neighbor outside and striking up a convo.

So of course this is purely subjective and can be a hit or miss, but Iâ€™m curious, what kind of beer would you suggest for a 70+ Midwestern man?

* **Portability & Convenience**: Cans 5/5, Bottles 2/5
   * *Cans win for outdoor adventures and stack easily, while bottles are heavier and breakable.*
* **Cost**: Cans 4/5, Bottles 2/5

The London Beer Flood was an accident at Meux & Co's Horse Shoe Brewery, London, on 17 October 1814. It took place when one of the 22-foot-tall (6.7 m) wooden vats of fermenting porter burst. The escaping liquid dislodged the valve of another vessel and destroyed several large barrels: between 128,000 and 323,000 imperial gallons (580,000â€“1,470,000 L; 154,000â€“388,000 US gal) of beer were released in total."

Butâ€¦ Iâ€™m tired. Iâ€™m tired of thinking about it, running around to get the best one. 

I feel like Iâ€™m easing into my â€œCarlsbergâ€ years. I just want to stock my fridge with a 24 and not overthink it. Iâ€™m ready for a house beer.

The problem is, despite all the craft breweries around, Iâ€™m finding it hard to nail one down that fits my criteria, so Iâ€™m hoping for some help.

Hereâ€™s what I am looking for:
-available in 355cans or even better 341bottles.
-ideally available in bulk and not TOO expensive though that is relative and am willing to pay if needed
-ideally craft beer but Iâ€™m starting to think none will fit this bill so open to â€˜gaspâ€™ macro
-5%abv or less
-available in Ontario - and delivery across Ontario as Iâ€™m in Kingston

So far, Iâ€™ve tried
-Muskoka detour (not as good as it used to be. I had high hopes for this one but nope)
-lug lite (not off the table but not great)
-Muskoka tread lightly (loathed it)
-miller high life (sad to this this one is currently in the lead :()
-miller lite (tied with high life)
-side launch light lager (this one isnâ€™t bad)
-Modelo especial (donâ€™t like the beer but has a little skunk that is nostalgic which I kinda did)
-blood brothers blood light (this is my top beer from the category but get expensive since they donâ€™t sell by the case and need to pay shipping)
-Carlsberg (didnâ€™t try because you canâ€™t get in bottles anywhere around here)


On a side note: I LOATHE that every craft brewery is doing tall boys right now. IMHO if youâ€™re doing a light beer and putting it in tall boys youâ€™re doing it wrong. (I assume this was LCBOâ€™s doing so reckon they deserve the blame). 

Pretty close to just giving up and officially starting my Miller years."

Before I had that when I was 21, I really only drank craft beers because they were stronger and could give you a good buzz faster (Victory Golden Monkey, Lagunitas Brown Shugga, Weyerbacher Merry Monks, etc). But I started reading around and trying new beers and styles for the fun of it, not just to get drunk. I'll always remember having Fuller's ESB for the first time. I was so amazed by the whole experience of how complex the malts were, how much I loved the fruity esters, and how the herbal hops used really balanced it all out. This was in around 2018-ish, and unfortunately since then so many English ales aren't available anymore. Fuller's ESB is gone. Hobgoblin ruby isn't available near me anymore. The more mass produced examples (which weren't really as good anyway) have also disappeared (red hook ESB, honker's ale etc).   


Last April I had the privelidge of going to NERAX (New England Real Ale Exhibiton) and got to try so many cask ales from the UK and US. I'm 27, but I felt like a baby there with the average age probably being in the mid-to-late 40s. It was fascinating to learn how influential British beer styles and brewing culture were to the early craft beer movement in the US. Now, coming upon a British style at a store or a brewery is extemely uncommon. 

  
My question is this. Right now in the US, lagers are making a huge comeback as people are looking for something drinkable and lower ABV that is sessionable. Why aren't British styles a part of this resurgence? They are often even lower in ABV than many lager styles, and are often much more complex and interesting.

Nostalgic beer,6,1fwt9zc,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1fwt9zc/nostalgic_beer/,14,2024-10-05 22:43:57,"Hi!

Picture this. Ontario. 1988.

Iâ€™m a 9 year old boy. My dad leaves the room, and I take a sip of his beer. Itâ€™s gross. I hate it. But the taste makes an imprint.

Skunky. A bit vegetal.

I grew up, got into craft beer. IPAs, DIPAs, Imperial Stouts, sours.

All great - but Iâ€™ve still yet to taste that taste that I remember.

The closest was a Pacifico on vacation once. But I canâ€™t get that in Ontario.

The only clue I have is that I know my dad drank Oâ€™keefe at one point. But I canâ€™t get that here.

I imagine itâ€™s a taste found in macro beer? Iâ€™ve tried a couple with no luck. I tried Miller Lite and it had a hint of it in the first sip but then it disappeared.

So, I guess Iâ€™m wondering, what beers should I try that might have that nostalgic, skunky, mildly vegetal 80s dad beer taste? Know what I mean?"

I like Untapped and use it a lot, but it doesn't have an option for tracking people's homebrews which I try a lot of. It also doesn't have an offline option for entering your beers to be uploaded when I'm back online. 

I like Beer Free because it allows for both and I really just need a list to tick off beers and look back to see if I've had one."

Miller Highlife question,0,1fwqz1q,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1fwqz1q/miller_highlife_question/,28,2024-10-05 20:56:24,"Until this week I havenâ€™t drank Miller Highlife in months. My mom had a regular 12oz bottle of MHL in her fringe for months and didnâ€™t have any other beer so I took it upon myself to drink it and it tasted awful. Wasnâ€™t very bubbly for being the champagne of beers and had an extremely sweet corn syrupy flavor to it. I ended up only drinking half of it and havenâ€™t had it again until this week.

Earlier this week I was dying for a beer and was a day away from payday so I settled for a $1.69 32 oz bottle of Miller Highlife and it was so good I had to go by three more today. Perfect balance of light and flavorful. Easily chuggable and pleasantly sippable.

My question is, has any of you noticed MHL tasting better out of the big bottles as opposed to the standard 12oz variety? Or was the one in my momâ€™s fridge just too old? Iâ€™ve finished all three and have yet to taste that offputting sweet corn syrupy note."

From Burial Brewing: How to support Asheville after Helene,142,1fv9k0w,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1fv9k0w/from_burial_brewing_how_to_support_asheville/,12,2024-10-03 21:49:55,"Hi everybody -

The team at Burial Brewing in Asheville has been feeding the community and directing folks to fundraisers as they recover from the catastrophic flooding of Hurricane Helene (I know others like DSSOLVR are helping, but they're who I follow on Instagram). I emailed them to see if I could donate to them to help them with their efforts, and [as promised](https://old.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1fu4fei/asheville_breweries_devastated_by_helene_flooding/lq2fzz1/), here's the email I received:

---

Good Morning Folks,

I want to start by saying thank you to each of you who reached out to offer support. Itâ€™s been overwhelming to keep up with in the best possible way. Hearing from you is keeping us optimistic and moving forward. Iâ€™d also like to thank you for your patience as we tried to wrap our heads around where and how to direct these offers.

Weâ€™ve spent the past few days sorting through the abundance of information thatâ€™s out there and have settled on the following as a start.

**For those looking to support Asheville and WNC:**

**For those looking to support Burial Beer Co.:**

* **Overview** - As of Tuesday, October 1st, we have been in contact with 100% of Burial's Asheville Staff. Everyone is safe and accounted for. We're considering ourselves incredibly lucky that our Asheville locations did not sustain any major damage. Unfortunately, many of our friends and neighbors cannot say the same. Our timeline on reopening any Burial AVL locations will largely rely on the city's ability to re-establish a potable and running water supply, which we've heard may take weeks and up to months. That being said, our main focus right now is supplying hot meals, cold water, dry goods, feminine products, gas, and electricity to both our staff and the community.
* **Physical Donations** -
Both our Charlotte and Raleigh Taprooms are accepting donations that will be delivered to our South Slope Asheville Taproom. Additionally, UPS and FedEx have resumed service to Asheville. If you're interested and able to send dry goods, feminine products, or bottled water, our address is:

* **Volunteering** -
We are thankful to have the resources on our staff to handle our limited Asheville operations at the moment. For those of you looking to volunteer, we'd like to direct you to: volunteer@buncombecounty.org.
* **Financial Support** -
  * [GoFundMe for Asheville Hospitality Staff](https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-asheville-coworkers-in-recovery-together) - Our Charlotte Taproom Manager, Alissa Gavin, has created a fund that will benefit our AVL Bartenders and Kitchen Employees currently unable to work. 
  * [Charlotte](https://burialbeer.com/pages/charlotte-house-of-relics) & [Raleigh](https://burialbeer.com/pages/raleigh-the-exhibit) Taprooms - Both locations are currently open with standard operations. Come say hi to our teams, enjoy some pours, and take some beer to-go.
  * [Online Shop](https://burialbeer.com/pages/delivery-asheville-pickup) - Our Online Shop for Beer and Merchandise Shipping is active. We're working to catch up on orders received during the storm, as well as the new orders coming in each day. Shipping will likely be a bit slower than you're used to from us, but we will get you the goods as soon as we possibly can.
I know this is a lot, but please let me know if you have any questions. I will do my best to get back to everyone as quickly as possible.


Thank you,
The Burial Beer Co. Team"

> These are the sectors that could be the most impacted by the strike:

> Food and Beverage: The dozen or so U.S. ports affected by the strike import nearly $100 million a month of beverages and vinegar, according to a report from the Washington Post. According to the American Farm Bureau Federation via the Washington Post, 80% of all imported beer, whiskey, scotch and more come through the ports will be impacted by the strike.

> Constellation Brands. The maker of Modelo, is one of the companies that imports the most beer to the U.S., although Constellation may be able to avoid disruptions caused by the port through ground transportation from Mexico. Heineken NV and other European beverage companies may feel more of the strikeâ€™s affects.

The longshoreman strikes on the East Coast may cause the prices on imported beer, wine, and spirits to increase, as well as supply to decrease.  Some of the more popular imported brands like Modelo, Corona, Guinness and Heineken may see price increases and be harder to find.  If you regularly drink imported beer, you may want to stock up in case prices increase."

ColdFire Brewingâ€™s â€œFlavor Policeâ€ â€“ A Rant About Customer Choice and Brewery Elitism,0,1fv2ccb,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1fv2ccb/coldfire_brewings_flavor_police_a_rant_about/,34,2024-10-03 14:36:25,"Iâ€™ve got to say, Iâ€™ve had some great times at ColdFire Brewing Company in Eugene, Oregon. They make solid beer, and Iâ€™ve enjoyed supporting a local spot. But tonight? They really lost me with one of the most pretentious policies Iâ€™ve ever come across in any brewery.

Iâ€™ve been to breweries all over the country and made the same simple request at all of them: half IPA, half cider. I like the sweetness of the cider mixed with the hoppiness of the IPAâ€”itâ€™s a combo that works for me. But apparently, ColdFire doesnâ€™t care what its customers like. When I ordered this, the server told me itâ€™s company policy not to honor requests like this because (Iâ€™m paraphrasing here), the brewers work â€œreally hardâ€ to create flavor profiles, and customers need to â€œhonor that.â€ Yeah, really.

What? I thought I walked into a brewery, not the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld. â€œNo mixed drinks for you!â€ I made that exact comparison to the server, who looked at me like Iâ€™d just insulted their entire family. Seriously, though, the snobby disdain in the response was just off-putting.

And hereâ€™s the thing: Iâ€™ve never had a pub, bar, or brewery deny this simple request, which Iâ€™ve made dozens of times over many years at all kinds of places. But ColdFire? Theyâ€™re so wrapped up in their self-importance that they actually enforce this ridiculous policy, as if theyâ€™re doing us a favor by refusing what we like.

And letâ€™s get one thing straightâ€”denying a customerâ€™s requestâ€”even if it seems a bit weirdâ€”should NEVER be a company policy at a food and beverage establishment or anywhere in the service industry. The customerâ€™s preferences reign supreme, especially over the pride and ego of the chefs or, in this case, the brewers. Customers come to enjoy themselves, not be told their tastes are wrong.

FOOD AND DRINK IS PERSONAL. What tastes good to one person might taste like absolute trash to another. People alter their food and drinks to suit their own tastes all the time. Imagine a steakhouse refusing to give you salt because â€œthe chef seasoned it to perfection,â€ or an ice cream shop rejecting your request for two different flavors because â€œour chef determined those donâ€™t go together.â€ Itâ€™s absurd, right? But here we are.

ColdFire, youâ€™ve officially become one of the most pretentious and out-of-touch establishments in Eugene. Congratulations. Newsflash: customers come to enjoy themselves, not to bow down to some snobby, self-important idea of what â€œshouldâ€ be good.

Question about storing keg beer,5,1ftvpds,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1ftvpds/question_about_storing_keg_beer/,12,2024-10-02 01:46:32,"Hi! I poked around and kept getting different answers to this question so hoping for clarification. 

Iâ€™m getting married Saturday and had to pick up the kegs today (Rainier and Blue Moon). We donâ€™t have somewhere to store them, so I was planning on leaving them outside (temps range 50-58) until we can take it to the venue Thursday. Is this a horrible idea? The venue has a way to chill them again once they get there for Saturday. I havenâ€™t drank in years and have literally never bought a keg so Iâ€™m lost here haha. 

Thank you! "

Do you think it's safe to tap this upcoming Friday(So the beer would be 14 days tapped)? I'm not as concerned with taste, after all, it is keg beer, more with general safety.

Using a c-DGM Gehaltemeter for RTD,1,1fsucz5,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1fsucz5/using_a_cdgm_gehaltemeter_for_rtd/,1,2024-09-30 19:31:14,"Hello Hello, I have a question slightly outside the beer topic, but I know some breweries also produce RTD beverages. The other day, we were canning Cuba Libre, and something happened with the carbonation. Everything was measured using a c-DGM Gehaltemeter Haffmans CO2/O2, calibrated and clean:

* Carbonation in the BBT: 2.71 vol.
* Carbonation inline, at the filler inlet: 2.70 vol.
* Carbonation in the cans (average of 35 cans): 2.14 vol.

The cans were randomly selected from the packaging line and refrigerated until they reached an approximate temperature of 32-33 Â°F.

My question is the following: during the measurement, if I didnâ€™t fully open the flow on the equipment, the temperature didnâ€™t drop enough, showing a higher reading (the liquid was about 33 Â°F, but the equipment read 37 Â°F). For this type of product, where Iâ€™m only measuring CO2, what is the correct procedure? (I've never got this kind of problems with the beer, so, im asking for RTD).  Should I fully open the flow until the measurement stabilizes? If so, why does the pressure drop so much, and consequently the carbonation, when there was no breakout or foaming during filling?

Additionally, could it be that the CO2 loss is happening during filling and not due to incorrect measurement? Since this beverage has no proteins (unlike beer, which does allow CO2 retention), would it be advisable to add some additive to improve foam retention in the liquid? Thanks any comment is welcome!"

I want to see whatâ€™s out there in the beer world, try a little bit of everything I suppose! If it helps, the beers Iâ€™ve had so far are as follows:

-Bud Light
-Samuel Adams (Oktoberfest, Winter Lager, Summer Ale)
-Corona 
- Blue Moon

Given the ones I listed, I really enjoyed the Samuel Adams flavors the most. Blue Moon being second place, Corona third, and Bud Light being last. Thatâ€™s not because I donâ€™t like it, it just doesnâ€™t excite my palate much.

I'm a Belgian visiting London soon, so I'm looking for some beer recommendations. This isn't my first visit to London, but it will be the first visit since my ""discovery"" that I like the sweeter brown ales. Those include Rochefort 10, Gouden Carolus Imperial Dark, Chimay Bleu, Gulden Draak Classic, Sint-Bernardus Abt 12 and my absolute favourite : Kasteel Donker. 

I've been doing some research online, and it has lead me to things like milk stout, oatmeal stout, tropical stout and honey beer. I have to admit that I've ignored stout beers due to disliking Guinness. But apparently that's an imperial stout? The guesthouse I'm staying at is above an Irish pub, so I'm assuming they'll have quite a few stouts for me to try.

My current ""list"" of beers to try (or bring with me) consists of only 2 beers atm : Left Hand Nitro Milk Stout and Samuel Smith oatmeal stout. I'd love to expand this list with some other sweet British beers. Doesn't necessarily have to be stout.

And then I looked up craft beer options in Madrid, and one of them was just 2 blocks from where we were staying!

It was the first beer I'd had in 3 weeks. Beer's not much available in Muslim Morocco, and from what I'd read, what there is isn't really worth the effort. I briefly wondered if after 3 weeks off I would have lost my taste for beer. That didn't happen. I had a flight of #s 8, 9, 10, and 13 off the menu. #8 was particularly delicious."

After the 16th century, beers began to regularly include this ingredient. For years, only a mixture of herbs and spices was used to slightly alter its flavor, around the 1100s AD.

The nun **Hildegard von Bingen** (1098-1179), in a German monastery, wrote a treatise on the benefits of hops, beer, and the use of hops in it. Based on the fact that sweet drinks were heavily consumed, which led to vision problems and blindness, Hildegard suggested that the bitterness of beer counteracted the overconsumption of such beverages.

Thanks to Hildegard, hops were identified as growing in the chapel of Bavaria and became recognized as a key ingredient in beer. It wasnâ€™t until 1400 that hops reached the Netherlands, and in 1519 it was condemned as a bad herb. Not until the 16th century was it included as a basic ingredient."

Yet it tastes like Molson. The Wisconsin Miller Lite has a very distinct pils nose and flavor.

Guinness Extra Stout. Itâ€™s %0.4 weaker than the Irish version. It lacks body, flavor, and is fizzy as if thereâ€™s zero nitro in it. Nitro or not itâ€™s just way more fizzy and empty tasting.

Grolsch. Honestly itâ€™s been awhile since I drank an original. But this is flabby and barely palatable. It should be a little more hop sharp and slightly sea sprayâ€™esque.

The problem here is if youâ€™ve never experienced the originals you either like the under contract versions for what they are or you donâ€™t. And I think that Molson and maybe a little less so Labatt, have always wanted to homogenize and lower the expectations of the beer drinking experience.

Or perhaps this is a result of their vertical integration of procuring grains and hops, combined with their standardized brewing process.

Either way Iâ€™m done with these companies. If you agree contact your local convenience stores and grocery to pressure them to have variety."

- New Belgium Brewing (Colorado, USA):Â This brewery is a pioneer in the sustainable beer movement. They run on 100% wind power, have an impressive water conservation system, and even use a methane-powered co-gen engine to turn waste into energy. Plus, they're a certified B Corporation, which is always good!

- Camden Town Brewery (Camden Town, London):Â Despite supporting the worst team in North London, Camden Town Brewery is dedicated to sustainability, using 100% renewable electricity, recycling brewing waste, and minimising material use in packaging. They also conserve water and collaborate with local farmers and a UK charity to reduce environmental impact.

- Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. (California, USA):Â Known for their zero-waste initiative, Sierra Nevada recycles or reuses nearly 100% of their waste. They've also invested heavily in solar energy and have one of the largest privately-owned solar arrays in the U.S. Their commitment to water conservation and sustainable agriculture is also top-notch.

- To Ã˜l (Copenhagen, Denmark):Â To Ã˜l operates out of a facility they've dubbed ""To Ã˜l City,"" which is all about zero-waste and circular economy principles. They're using local, organic ingredients and innovative packaging solutions that make their operations as sustainable as possible.

What other sustainable breweries do you know of? Before anyone mentions BrewDog, please do look at the shit show that company has become. "

I am in Saigon Vietnam now and grabbed a few Asahis at 7-11 but the moment I took a sip from the first one, I knew something was off.  Not only did it not taste the same, but I have never tasted a beer that tasted like some sort of chemical in my entire life.  It was very pronounced.  I cracked open another one and same thing.  I asked my wife to take a sip and she immediately agreed something is way off.  I then inspected the can and it said this on the side. 

â€œby Shenzhen Tsingtao Beer
Asahi Breweries, Ltd., Tokyoâ€
www.asahisuperdry.com

I assumed it was from Japan, but I guess it is a Chinese brewed one, but why so different and why such an awful chemical taste?  Surely Asahi has quality control?  What could have caused this?  Left in the hot sun?  Did I drink a fake beer?   Has anyone had this experience with other beers?  

Also, unsure if related, but about an hour after having those sips (maybe 2 oz/60ml total) my toes on both my feet suddenly curled up with the most intense cramp I have ever experienced and it took 30 mins of massage and hot water to calm them down. I rarely get cramped toes and never for more than a second or two on one foot so this was a big surprise.  So much so that it has me wondering if that beer was poison in some way?  I looked into causes of extreme toe cramps and the only possible thing that jumped out was poisoning as there was no other cause that rang as even possible.  

Will post on a Vietnam subreddit as maybe the locals have some insights.

My question is the following : can Somebody give me some explanation in re the worldwide hops trend ? What I mean is : what happened ? I remember my earlier youth (I'm 34 now), when I was in my teens, in Chile, and nowhere would You find anything termed Â« IPA Â», or Â« APA Â», nor any Â« special Â» beer, and no beer would have hops flavour. All there was was bottled beers (or canned) which You'd get at shops, and they were just... what I'd call Â« regular Â» beers. No hops.

But then all of a sudden (well, if You can call a decade or couple of decades as Â« sudden Â»), suddenly hops everywhere. And specialty beers, and bars that make their special beers, etc. And it seems to Me that this happened quite all over the world. Again : IPAs, APAs, ales, hops and hops.

Can Somebody explain ?, if there's something to be explained beyond just telling Me Â« it's a trend Â» ?

We tapped one and the customers said it tasted â€œweirdâ€.  The labels have a date marked 2022 and another 2023 with â€œcellarâ€ stamped under them.  The rep says the date doesnâ€™t matter because they â€œageâ€ in the barrels and thatâ€™s what â€œcellarâ€ means.  Itâ€™s a stout.

Curious what beers you recommend, especially ones that I could find at places like Total Wine & More or something.  

Not a beer expert. I think my favorite notes are citrus, dry, earthy, malty, floral/herbal?  I usually settle for a west-coast ipa or a Pilsner. 

Iâ€™m in NC, USA. If anyone is in the NC, VA, or MD region, Iâ€™d love those recommendations too, even if they donâ€™t distribute! "

Anyhow, I was just drinking an Augustiner Festbier on my one weekend home in Munich (Iâ€™m American my wife is from here) and I was wondering what the ranking of the classic six Oktoberfest biers are. I have a pretty good idea of where the six breweriesâ€™ helles beers sit (Augustiner, Hacker Pschorr, Paulaner, HofbrÃ¤u, Spaten, LÃ¶wenbrÃ¤u are how they stack up according to the Germans I know more than or less) but I was a little less than pleased with my Augustiner Fest that I thought perhaps the ranking is different.

Help Finding a Beer,0,1fh6ea3,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1fh6ea3/help_finding_a_beer/,4,2024-09-15 13:43:39,"Dragons Milk. Im not a beer drinker or alcohol drinker at all. I usually donâ€™t really enjoy beer or the taste of alcohol But I always say yes to any drink thatâ€™s offered to me to atleast give it a shot. 

Friend brought over a Dragons Milk and some bourbons after I had a Guinness and sip of some other alcohol earlier that night.  All of them were okay but I just didnâ€™t like the bourbons.  I tried the dragons milk thoughâ€¦btw I wasnâ€™t drunk only maybe slightly floaty. I took one sip and instantlyâ€¦..this was such an AMAZING DRINK. The sweetness and fruitiness and darkerâ€¦idk undertones?? I couldnâ€™t believe my taste buds. Loved every sip of it.  I need this again. 

Canâ€™t remember what kind it was though. Definitely not the crimson. I donâ€™t know if it was the Stout or Triple Mash but I need it again.  I do know for sure it wasnâ€™t the crimson or a flavor like for example Oatmeal.  I got a 4 pack of the stout yesterdayâ€¦.but it doesnâ€™t taste like what I remembered. It wasnâ€™t as sweet or fruity.

Does anyone know what Iâ€™m looking for and can point me in the right direction? I donâ€™t have that friends number so I canâ€™t contact him for it. "

Recommendations wanted,3,1fgrifz,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1fgrifz/recommendations_wanted/,5,2024-09-15 00:36:03,"So Iâ€™ve tried to get into beers/ciders since college (now in my 30s) and I just canâ€™t seem to find something. I used to drink Reddâ€™s Apple Ale, but now I donâ€™t even enjoy that.
Iâ€™m not looking to get tanked, Iâ€™m just looking for something nice to sip on after work. 
Iâ€™ve done some online research for about 2 weeks now, and have gone and done a pick your own 6pack from the local store.
The only thing Iâ€™ve liked so far is Angry Orchard cider, and thatâ€™s after letting it go semi-flat. 
I donâ€™t like a heavy or overpowering wheat flavor, Iâ€™m a fan of sour/fruity, but flavor matters to me way more than it probably should. 

Drinks Iâ€™ve tried so far:
Shock Top
Lazy Hiker IPA
Sam Adams Cherry Wheat (smelled great tasted awful)
Angry Orchard (liked)
Heineken (didnâ€™t enjoy, but didnâ€™t hate)
Bud light "
CO2/Keg advice,3,1fgr3vn,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1fgr3vn/co2keg_advice/,4,2024-09-15 00:17:58,"Hello. I am having a problem with my new keg setup and Iâ€™m having trouble finding anyone with a similar issue online. 

I got this set up a month ago. Two sixel kegs in a kegerator hooked up to two taps. I have attached a 5 lb CO2 tank to the kegs. 

For the first week it ran no problems. The pours were foamy but after fiddling with the pressure levels I got it pouring well. Then the CO2 tank ran out with both kegs still about half full. I rubbed soap on all the points of escape and found a leak, applied sealant to it and it stopped leaking there. Hooked up a new tank and it poured well, but less than a week later, same problem. The kegs were empty now, replaced them, hooked up a new tank and couldnâ€™t find another leak. 

This is the part where Iâ€™m not finding anyone with the same issue. I followed some instructions I found online:

1. pressurize the regulator until the low pressure gauge is reading 10 psi

2. close the valve between the regulator and the hose and shut off the tank 

The instructions said the pressure should stay the same. What happened was they stayed the same for two minutes, then quickly increased to 25 psi, before suddenly dropping to zero. I tried this twice and the same thing happened each time. 

This is a full tank of CO2 and when I set everything up normally it is pouring beer out of both taps no issue, but I am confused about why my tanks are going empty so fast. 

Has anyone had an issue like this before? Iâ€™m thinking I may need to replace the regulator? Iâ€™m not sure what other troubleshooting to do and I want advice from people more experienced than me before I spend more money on this thing. 

Thank you. "

What's your limit for prices at a brewery?,81,1fcwnho,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1fcwnho/whats_your_limit_for_prices_at_a_brewery/,176,2024-09-10 01:31:33,"In the US I'm seeing more and more breweries pouring smaller beers for either the same or increased prices.  

Just saw one recently that doesn't do anything about 14oz regardless of the ABV, anything above 7% is 10oz and they charge $7-$9 for those smaller pours.   I do like the brewery experience but these prices make it hard.  I can get great beers for $5-$6 for 16oz in a can which is basically what I've ended up doing.

For me it's not worth it at some breweries, just curious what other people's limit is."

I planned on getting some cheap insulated jackets for them and I want to get two containers I can set them in and fill will ice. They'll be inside the venue for the reception. I will probably pick them up late that morning (maybe like 1030 or 11), load them in my truck and drive up to the venue spot about 20 minutes from me, unload them then head out to get some ice. The wedding start time is 5pm. 

I see a keg is about 16"" diameter and I'm seeing containers that are a 17.5"" width. Do I need something wider? Taller? What would you recommend? I'm picking them up from a local bar, and the guy said he would keep them in the 40 degree cooler in the back for me with their other kegs, do I even need the insulated jackets?

I am looking to add 6 new draught keg beer lines to my licensed premesis which I own freehold. Currently there is no celllar and I have no taps.

I have all planning and licensing in order for a new cellar area and 6 lines, the cellar being behind the current bar (under 5 meters from keg to tap in a straight line) I am very capable doing any building out work, drilling walls for trunking, connecting things up ect.

However my knowledge of how to design this system is limited to speaking with equipment suppliers and reading/watching websites/YouTube.

At the moment Im thinking I could have a stab at creating this system, buying and installing the parts myself. However I'm concerned I may hit pitfalls or poorly design it. 

I will not be doing the phyiaical cellar room build or the electrics/cellar cooling myself. I am only considering creating the keg draught system.

Is there any good information/resources/recommend training you can share given the above.

If I'm way off the mark and I'm crazy to even attempt it, please let me know aswell.

Thank you.

While it used to be seasonal.... it seems they're currently keeping this going indefinitely as it's now been extended until the end of the year. To me, Guinness is a great session beer that is widely available, but my main complaint has always been that it's just a touch too expensive for what it is. This rebate knocks it down to the $1 per 12oz territory (if you're buying the nitro 8 packs), which is pretty great (it's about $15-16 at my grocery store).

I buy Guinness semi-regularly so I've been taking full advantage. The money is typically venmoed to you in a few days.  I think there's a limit of 4 uses per month per person.

For the unaware, there are two styles of German Oktoberfest bier. In America, we generally only see the older style called MÃ¤rzen, which is an amber very malty style that was traditionally aged half a year (hence the name. Most is not aged nowadays and the flavor is achieved via other means though some still age theirs). 

The more modern variant is known as festbier and is somewhere in between a MÃ¤rzen and a standard helles lager. Malty, slightly hoppy, easy drinking with a surprising kick of alcohol. It was generally very hard to find in the US outside of certain imports, compared to MÃ¤rzen. "

The reason why I ask is that I love bitter but will probably have to leave the UK for some years at least to pursue a career in academia.

Edit: some confusion about real ale vs ale. Real ale is a subset of ale. It has been pointed out to me that a better word to use might be cask beer. I'm not asking where you can get any ale because Guinness is ubiquitous but not what I want."

Well to me it had a strong aroma of alcohol, maybe like a port wine,  it looked like used motor oil in the glass.  It had left some funky brown deposits on the blue glass bottle.  I tried it and immediately thought of a port wine that is starting to turn, I would drink it in small quantities.  Maybe a addition to some winter cocktail creation.  The wife's reaction is a bit more intense, I really wish I could post a photo of the face she made.  The works out her mouth were ""yuck, rancid, how the hell can you drink that"".

My next thought was to try a triple bock spriz.  presico,  triple bock and club soda. Maybe that would help.

He will only drink Boddingtons and Belhaven Scottish Ale/Belhaven Black Stout now, with the occasional FORGD Stout or Guinness Draught at the bar or when a restaurant wonâ€™t let you BYO. But he says nothing comes close to the taste of authentic John Smithâ€™s from his dadâ€™s hometown in England. 

Is it sold in the U.S. at all? I live in New Jersey, between the Newark-Trenton area. Iâ€™m willing to pay $200 to get him as much as I can as a Christmas gift. 

If not, how would I go about importing it? Itâ€™s for personal use, obviously, but would I need a permit or documents for it?

Iâ€™ve been sampling cask ales around town (Stockholm) and so far been let down. Right now Iâ€™m trying Timothy Taylorâ€™s Boltmaker (tried Knowle Spring Blonde too) from a reputable bar (it has the â€œCask Marqueâ€ certification and a Timothy Taylor Champion Club plaque)

To me, the beer is slightly too warm (not cold enough), slightly too flat, and lacking anything that stands out flavor wise. I get that the point is for it to be this way, but the only substance Iâ€™m getting is a tea like astringency. A little dusty. 

The only one Iâ€™ve liked decent was a darker mild; it felt more appropriate for a darker beer, creamier, smooth. 

I respect these bars so maybe itâ€™s just a me thing. I havenâ€™t traveled to the UK and wonâ€™t give up yet. But for now Iâ€™d prefer the beer on normal draft. "

I never really got into beer until I visited Munich in 2015. Since then, Hefeweizens have been my go to beers. I've tried several, and here is my take.

Weihenstephan - this is the one where I notice variations from batch to batch, so it's a bit or miss for me. I've noticed that some have a stronger note of clove, and I really don't like them. The ones I've gotten that had strong banana note, I think are the best I've had. But again, it's inconsistent in my opinion, so it's not my go to.

KÃ¶nig Ludwig Weissbier- it's been a few years since I've had it, so I can't really comment on specifics, but I know that it's probably almost my favorite or at least top 3

Franziskaner- I don't think it's quite as good as the  best weihenstephans or Ludwig's ive had, but it's very consistent, and (at least for me) easy to find. I'd describe this one as a more bready taste.

I had some of the Hofbrau Hefeweizen last week, it was pretty good, but seemed a bit more bitter than other Hefeweizens.

Ive probably tried the Hefeweizens from most or all of the Munich breweries, but none of them were memorable enough for me to comment on or good enough for me to have continue purchasing.

What are your favorite Hefeweizens?"

El Guapo has a translucent, burnt-orange appearance, with a thin, off-white head and a bit of lacing. The aroma is of rich, dark bread crust and a possible agave touch. The flavor is of white bread crust and noticeable and unusual bitterness. El Guapo has a medium body and a mostly-dry finish."

Got home to put it in the fridge and noticed the date printed on it was two months out. I know some breweries will print a can date vs an expiration date, but after a quick search apparently Goose Island prints expiration dates. So I went back to the store and showed them the date on the box, and they told me I was wrong and that was the can date, and the expiration date was the one next to it. The serial code. If that were the case it would have expired on December 9th, 2002 even though it was canned on June 24th, 2024. Apparently they think beer retro-expires and they wouldnâ€™t have it, and not wanting to start an argument, I just took it and left. Even if it was December 2024, I would think hop character would significantly degrade in that amount of time.

There are always those people at the bar that add a pinch of salt to ""enhance"" flavors or to make it less flat - IMO I'm not a fan.

Just with a quick google search, [Guinness Nitrosurge | Official Global Site](https://nitrosurge.guinness.com/en/), seems to have a device for specialty beer cans. However, you have to use special cans that are not sold in the US. IMO their US canned beer is nothing like what you get in Ireland, so if this works it would be revolutionary.

Then there are also the machines (like [Amazon.com : Chill-O-Matic Instant Beverage Cooler. You can Chill a 12 Ounce Can of Beer or Soda in just 60 Seconds with This Portable Cooling Device : Home & Kitchen](https://www.amazon.com/Chill-Matic-Automatic-Beverage-Chiller/dp/B01DFPM5PE?th=1)) that get your beer ice cold. This maybe a bigger deal for light beer.

This leads to canned Hazy IPA. These are really impacted by the time they sit on a shelf. I was wondering with the beer expects on this sub: is there are any other ways to make these canned beers taste more consistent?

Other than those above and besides tapping a keg, is there anything I'm missing?"

To me, banquet is too sweet and Budweiser is too boring. Busch is not great and hamms just taste cheap for some reason. Ik your answer is going to be â€œcraftâ€ or they all taste the same but idc give me a discussion. Is their one you would drink in a certain situation over the other? Lmk your thoughts! Seems like a fun comparison. 

To me: miller high life tastes like how beer should taste. Almost like a corn flavored soda. But in a good way? PBR tastes a little more bold to me. Obviously they are similar in that macro brew category. "

I donâ€™t care for Australian beers but had tried Budweiser and appreciated the easy drinking style of lager.
I was interested in trying PBR as the general consensus seemed to be that itâ€™s better than Budweiser. Unfortunately itâ€™s not brewed here (anymore) and everywhere online that has sold imports was out of stock, so I had added my email to many lists so I would be notified when itâ€™s back in stock.
3 days ago I got that email. Without thinking I jumped at the opportunity and forked out $117.30 for a case of 24 tallboys. I watched the tracking like a hawk, excited for the day it would arrive. That day was today!
I put 6 cans in the refrigerator and anxiously awaited the strike of 12pm so I could reasonably drink a beer without feeling like an alcoholic.
Upon the strike of 12pm I cracked open my first can, andâ€¦â€¦ itâ€™s fine..
Not worth $117.30 for a case.

So yeah, Iâ€™ll just go lick my wounds and hope the more I drink the better it gets."

One of the visual cues I see is that the standard American brown in my glass has a head that will never dissipate. It just keeps foaming over the brim without cratering. I was thinking maybe a diastatic yeast or bacteria of some sort, but interestingly when I search around it says this would have the opposite effect on head retention. Any other hypotheses out there?"

I suppose my questions are these:

1. Is there a better approach?
2. If not, we figured \~20-30 bottles of wine for \~150 people. How many cans of beer should we get?
3. (not really a beer drinker) What types of beer should we get? 2-4 different types?
4. Are seltzers a good compromise?

Its not because I think wheat beers are boring because I love Allagash White and Hoegaarden but those are witbiers and I think the American Pale Wheat Ale style is vastly inferior and it needs fruit to jazz it up. Its really hot out and I just had a Great Lakes Strawberry Pineapple Wheat and was so good and you could tell they didnt use artificial flavors and only real ingredients. Ive been seeking out all the fruit flavored wheat ales I can find and Im open to suggestions.

She enjoys non-alcoholic here in the states, mainly Athletic and Guinness 0, but was worried she wouldn't have many options on the trip.

Boy were we wrong.

Almost every pub we visited in London and Edinburgh had multiple options. Most times each new pub would have one or two she hadn't seen yet. On top of that, some places had a non-alcoholic on draught which she was incredibly excited to see (I think it was Lucky Saint that was on draft the few times we saw this).

This allowed her to pub crawl with me and have as much fun with it as I did.

It was really impressive to see how many options there were. Hopefully we see those types of options here in the states soon, especially a draught option here and there."

Beer similar to Ind Coope Long Life,2,1ed2lyt,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1ed2lyt/beer_similar_to_ind_coope_long_life/,2,2024-07-27 06:50:02,"Iâ€™m attempting to find a beer similar to Ind Coope Long Life for an ageing relative.
It was brewed specially for canning in the 60s-80s in the UK, it apparently called itself a pale ale but on further inspection of old inactive beer forums it sounds like it was a sweetish lager brewed with Hallertau hops so sounds more like a German Helles, but Iâ€™m guessing this probably wouldnâ€™t taste similar. Hard to know having never tried the original. Weâ€™ve tried him on a few modern pale ales, even simpler less hoppy ones and theyâ€™re not the taste heâ€™s after.  

Does anyone know of anything that would fit the bill I could buy in the UK (London ish), that isnâ€™t Budweiser, thatâ€™s been suggested previously by friends, but heâ€™s not a fan. 

Found on untappd but canâ€™t post it, sounds like the original company were bought by Calsberg and the beer was discontinued. "

* Schaefer beer  
* Schell's Deer Brand  
* Anchor Steam Beer  
* Great Western Brewing Company Lager  
* Carling Canada Black Label  

I live in NY so most of the beers in the NY, PA area we've gotten our hands on but short of taking some road trips some of these seems pretty hard to come by since shipping beer seems to be a limited option at best.

Is Miller Lite a â€œredneckâ€ beer?,0,1ed9xvj,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1ed9xvj/is_miller_lite_a_redneck_beer/,45,2024-07-27 13:38:07,"hello all, this is a question for our American beer lovers on this forum.

Iâ€™m sitting here in Melbourne (Australia ) enjoying a few Miller Lite. 

This is a special occasion for us as this beer is not available here. A mate brought it over after a trip to the USA. We rarely have access to it.

Itâ€™s a special beer for us because we had an absolutely phenomenal week in Las Vegas to celebrate turning forty (eight years ago now). Many miller lite were drunk during that trip. 

Iâ€™ve been told by one of our mates that Miller Lite is considered a â€œredneck beerâ€ in the US. In fact when he was sitting on the verandah enjoying a miller lite in his last trip to the US (Washington) with his family there he was told â€œall we need is a pickup truck and a confederate flagâ€

Is miller lite a redneck beer?"

I drank 33 American lagers so you don't have to,721,1ah7fq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1ah7fq1/i_drank_33_american_lagers_so_you_dont_have_to/,296,2024-02-02 23:17:41,"I've run the gamut on exploring different beer styles and have grown tired of the craft beer game. I've been drinking (good) lager most of the time lately, and have been thinking about how I've never had a shit lager phase. I drank mostly fruity vodka drinks and Crown Royal in college, and when I turned 21, I discovered the craft beer section at the grocery store and went from there. Then I started thinking, I should put together a shitty lager tasting and torture my friends! Now I've finally done it.
   
There are a lot of beers in this category, so I limited myself to 33, all American, including a handful of Michigan brewed and regional options. Most of these beers were within recommended freshness. 

We first sampled all 33 beers in one night. Getting through it all was a struggle. Trying so many similarly tasting beers in one night is *very* mentally exhausting, not to mention the exhaustion of excessive drinking. Yet, at the very end, the #1 beer was unanimously decided, and everyone's top 5 was pretty damn close. For the 4 months after the tasting, I drank several more of each to fine tune my ratings and comments. I drank them grouped by brewery, I've drank them worst to best, and I've done more side-by-sides than I can count. I questioned why I was laboring so hard over this pointless ranking... but I had to keep on going.
   
Perhaps the most eye-opening part of all this was how profoundly shitty it made me feel. The hangover made me feel so remarkably disgusting, considerably more so than craft beer ever has, and in a qualitatively different way. I'm thinking it's the dog food grade ingredients used in these shitty lagers. I hope to never feel that way again.

Anyways... on to the ranking!

#[The Killshot](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/3e3a9798fba856c2c497652d7fba5b77_c_1351703492_raw.jpeg)
    
1. [High Life](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/6a19a589b975bfbd571abcf0e4e26d0b_c_1351728906_raw.jpeg) - 4/5 - The champagne of beers is unanimous winner of the 33 shit lager showdown. Wonderfully balanced, flavorful, and clean maltiness with a well balanced hop note. This truly sets the standard for American macro lager.

2. [Pabst Blue Ribbon Extra](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/6fe817048ac162db1a589cc8fea60438_c_1351727722_raw.jpeg) - 4/5 - I am surprised by how good this is compared to regular PBR. It's bolder but tastes like better quality ingredients too. There's a bit of a spicy earthy toasty hop thing, and a more substantial maltiness and body. Great stuff! It's also the only mass market lager I found packaged using the plastic PakTech can carriers.

3. [Coors Banquet](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/7b4e5174d56b143c9a2a136b842f2154_c_1351726697_raw.jpeg) - 4/5 - Easily top 3 American shit lagers. Super clean crispy malts, light balanced hops, a touch of sweetness, and an almost creamy carbonation profile. It just tastes good.

4. [Hamms](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/86fd4815d92ac6ccbc29b16e065f688e_c_1351726314_raw.jpeg) - 3.75/5 - Surprised myself with how much I like this one. Superbly clean and crispy, maybe a touch sweeter than others but tastes great. I miss the Hamms Instagram account

5. [Rolling Rock](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/c1860d79e0d1f99e897db03ecf35c8f3_c_1351725860_raw.jpeg) - 3.75/5 - Crispy, super clean malt, melon rind hop, with great balance. It's delightfully simple and infinitely crushable. Very well executed.

6. [Bud Ice](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/8db71c26e5166caad86c66f9fef24def_c_1351724203_raw.jpeg) - 3.75/5 - I love this label, makes me think of 90s-era ice hockey. Tastes surprisingly good. It's definitely stronger but it's not offensively bold like most other ice beers. Maybe a little more prominent wood flavor smoothing things out aside the crispy clean maltiness. Huge spread across the rankings from Budweiser!

7. [Budweiser](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/19b841c856338a6a0e43a46d129547f2_c_1351723555_raw.jpeg) - 3.5/5 - My late grandfather's beer of choice, because everything else gives you brain cancer. I like it too. Beechwood gives the clean crushable maltiness a smooth woody flavor that I probably wouldn't notice if I wasn't overanalyzing it.

8. [Old Style](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/f8ff28505fa3c2022b602fe45107f3e0_c_1351723127_raw.jpeg) - 3.5/5 - Chicago's favorite. It's maybe a little sweeter than most of the others but brings good body, a deliciously clean maltiness, and a light earthy hop.

9. [Strohs](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/83d58fdfa1969a792c00babda389da78_c_1351722825_raw.jpeg) - 3.5/5 - Formerly brewed in Detroit. Super clean maltiness with a well balanced melony lychee hop thing going on. My dad loves to tell me about his relatives who could drink on the job at the Stroh's factory (but not too much!). Anotehr fun fact - Stroh's spelled backwards is Short's!

10. [Altes](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/52c355dfa1f510a713c81e939fc8421b_c_1351722035_raw.jpeg) - 3.5/5 - Earthy bitter hops and piney sweetness atop a toasted caramel malty base and a crushable body. Maybe crystal malt? Nice hoppy amber vibes. Probably doesn't fit the category all that well, but I'm glad I've tried this Detroit classic.

11. [Michelob Ultra Pure Gold](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/45503b76bfc1b25eecb452b0cfc7fcd3_c_1351721320_raw.jpeg) - 3.5/5 - Better flavor than regular Ultra. Nice clean crispy grainy lagery goodness. I'm thinking that going organic must also meant better ingredients.

12. [Michelob Ultra](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/55dc8cbf5f54a8ca2346adf100cce120_c_1351720724_raw.jpeg) - 3.25/5 - Not bad for a light beer! Crispy and clean, maybe a touch of sweet cereal grains. Ultra light flavor overall, but the flavor that is there is surprisingly decent. It also keeps a consistent flavor as it warms up, which is why it ranks so high on my list.

13. [Pabst Blue Ribbon](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/365b6f4a5eaea49f0a78e66d8d88201f_c_1351719655_raw.jpeg) - 3.25/5 - This is pretty much exactly what I think of when I picture the average American shit lager. Crispy and mostly clean with a little toasted malt and earthy hop, but the ingredients taste cheap overall.

14. [Coors Light](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/faee680671cca497c260ac9ade74e9fa_c_1351719275_raw.jpeg) - 3.25/5 - Coors has their carbonation profile down very well. Nice crispiness without the carbonic acid flavor other light beers have. There is a little clean malt flavor but it's pretty light. Tastes very meh when the carbonation dies down.

15. [Miller Genuine Draft](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/95be8f76debcce5f865763df04b6108f_c_1351718587_raw.jpeg) - 3.25/5 - Awesome label. Beer is fine. Less flavorful than High Life. Maybe a little sweeter and a little more artificial tasting. 

16. [Solid Gold](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/b32158e8c3b5fd3ff073397133ea9ead_c_1351718049_raw.jpeg) - 3.25/5 - Sweet grainy aroma. Tastes a lot less artificial than the typical American lager, not to mention more complex, but its slapped right back down by gross corn flavor.

17. [Michelob Original](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/37294c62e0bc80db186f062634451482_c_1351717581_raw.jpeg) - 3.25/5 - I didn't know this still existed! This is the hoppiest of the bunch, but that's not saying much. A light floral and earthy hop atop a clean yet slightly caramelly maltiness.

18. [Natural Ice](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/0ad145fa017717a8adedfd632b79857d_c_1351717051_raw.jpeg) - 3.25/5 - A little bolder than the average shit lager. A little melony hop and a crispy clean malty base. Some cans have hints of doo doo Natty Daddy flavor. Its inconsistent, just like Natty Daddy, but its usually on the better side

19. [Old Milwaukee Light](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/6c2793b263d1662c5be7f0e82fee28c8_c_1351716320_raw.jpeg) - 3.25/5 - Another light beer that tastes very similar to the original, just a little lighter overall. A little drier too. A rare case of the light beer tasting better than the regular!

20. [Old Milwaukee](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/e58d5fc7f541c57cd089651e9ab1cbf9_c_1351715819_raw.jpeg) - 3.25/5 - Somewhat sweet cereal grains, like off brand Lucky Charms, and a clean finish. This is the only beer of this lineup I had to buy in 30 rack form, but I don't think I'll have a problem smashing through it.

21. [Bud Light](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/3d42b5fba88293261a2f9358c3771f4b_c_1351714982_raw.jpeg) - 3/5 - Light and crisp with a nice clean maltiness. A little more carbonic bite. Not much else to it, which I suppose is the point.

22. [Strohs Light](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/4d47f2fb953dad2fd03cfc14e3bd12ee_c_1351714500_raw.jpeg) - 3/5 - Much lighter and less flavorful than the OG. There's a little carbonic astringency to it, but there's still some good flavor of the OG in there. It gets better as carbonation settles.

23. [Miller Light](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/7b9c4e51c0765995b5dafd0ccf2fe11f_c_1351713607_raw.jpeg) - 3/5 - My first beer! I hated it then, but it's tolerable now. Certainly lighter than their other beers but theres some decent clean malty flavors in there.

24. [Natural Light](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/fee828af2a15a1dcc8d5c7d8d49c4f9c_c_1351712910_raw.jpeg) - 3/5 - Nothing spectacular but it's light, crispy, clean, and inoffensive. I didn't hate drinking it. Although, I once drank this warm on an island with a local hermit, and it was pretty enjoyable that day.

25. [Busch](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/79448458d4a36cef2e92ecfaccb804d1_c_1351711316_raw.jpeg) - 3/5 - Crisp and clean, but leaning hard into light beer territory in terms of flavor (or lack thereof) and abv at 4.3%. Getting a little corn coming through also.

26. [Busch Light](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/c00390b8938369196870eb3be956aed5_c_1351710118_raw.jpeg) - 3/5 - Crisp, clean, and a little corny. Tastes virtually the same as regular Busch, but it's also only 0.2% lighter so what's the point? If anything, it's just a little lighter and a little sweeter.

27. [ICEHOUSE](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/5fe379ccf1ca2498cc1914a8d76ab001_c_1351709617_raw.jpeg) - 2.75/5 - It is certainly bolder than most. A mix of potent grains, slightly caramelly with a surprisingly clean and crushable finish.

28. [Bud Select](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/fa5e3e0f41623b672dc523c7d7e944c8_c_1351709027_raw.jpeg) - 2.75/5 - Crisp clean and light. Just tastes of meh super cheap ingredients. This is the only expired beer in the lineup (by 2 months), but I'm not sure it'd be much better if fresher.

29. [Bud Select 55](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/3890426b9eb6a054dd5ba08f4058198b_c_1351708381_raw.jpeg) - 2.5/5 - Astringent carbonic acid, super light, void of flavor except some light and super cheap malt. Why the need for gross 2.4% 55 calorie beer? Just stop drinking!

30. [Natty Daddy](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/f215c04e174ec59b9edf4fee86dd94db_c_1351707639_raw.jpeg) - 2.5/5 - Definitely stronger than your average shit lager. Not great though. Kind of an off brand honey cereal thing with a little boozy heft. Some cans are okay, but some taste downright awful.

31. [Bud Light Platinum](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/c3a3200af4ccc8d526cb055746201f30_c_1351706335_raw.jpeg) - 2.5/5 - Why is a Bud Light variant their stronger than Bud Ice? This is bold in ways that do not taste good. Stronger shittier malt flavor and a heavier body. I can't believe so many people choose to drink this.

32. [Schlitz](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/98ae15d3804cfe7b06685a6ebca93429_c_1351704991_raw.jpeg) - 2.25/5 - Tastes like cheap sweet cereal grains, kind of a shitty caramel thing, and a little bitterness. It's gross.

33. [Bud Light Next](https://assets.untappd.com/photos/2024_01_27/62b5e6155d25220a60231152dcd30a15_c_1351704172_raw.jpeg) - 1.5/5 - This is truly awful. Overcarbonated and mostly tastes of carbonic acid with some astringent fruit flavor at the end. If it didn't say beer on the can, I would have thought this was a shitty attempt at a White Claw."

But I tend to get bored of a beer if I have too many of them so I always go get a variety to keep things interesting.

For my go-to's it's the Long Trail Survival Pack for local craft breweries and the Guinness Pub Pack for the macro's. The Survival Pack is changed seasonally between summer, fall and winter with the line up changing. So the current one in stores is the winter one which nets you standard Long Trail, VT IPA, Limbo IPA and Hibernator Scottish Ale. 12 beers for the standard cost of about 16 bucks (prices vary a lot depending on where you get it) is pretty alright as far as craft brews go. The Guinness Pub Pack is sold at a discount beer store currently for about 16 bucks, gets you 15 cans split between normal Guinness, Harp Lager and Smithwick Red. There's better dry stouts, pale lagers and red ales but imo none are as affordable or as available as Guinness so it's a good buy for me."

Pilsner Urquell guy back again ðŸ¤—,1,1gs4wsg,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1gs4wsg/pilsner_urquell_guy_back_again/,0,2024-11-16 02:46:05,"So we can say, I am just starting to enjoy beer. The taste, the â€œhoppynesâ€ (hope I spelt that right), the bitter aftertaste etcâ€¦.

I drank a lot of it, that for sure. But I have never appreciated good beer. I used to drink beer to get drunk, now I drink it because I enjoy it so much. 

The different experience you get with every different one, tasting the difference between canned, bottled and kegs. Donâ€™t get me wrong, itâ€™s a really nice feeling to get a bit tipsy after work, but that not the goal anymore. 

So, today I went into the local liquor store to get a tap for my Zahringer keg (not in production anymore, but for how cheap it was, man is it good from a keg) that my friend gave me who has a bar at home. 

Anyways, I found a really good deal. For 2,5 litres of bottled Pilsner Urquell and a Pilsner glass (jug? how do you call a beer bottle, English is not my specialty after drinking hahahah) I paid 8 fucking Euros. 8. And itâ€™s a holiday pack to be specific. I could not believe my eyes when seeing the price tag, especially after seeing that an 8 pack goes for 12 euros.

Itâ€™s a wonderful gift for myself ðŸ˜‚ But man, can you taste the difference between canned and bottled. Canned has a lighter body, and goes down realllly smooth. While bottled comes through with that wonderful hoppynes and a bitter aftertaste, while being more foamy and consistent. I am drinking the 3rd bottle with the same joy as I was drinking the first. 

My next step is to get a small keg of this. I mean, if itâ€™s this good from a bottle, how much better could it be unpasteurised from the factory? Come onnn, itâ€™s not fair.

I also bought an Erdinger? Wheat beer, first time drinking one and man, is it good. That light texture, canâ€™t even taste the alcohol and the aftertaste which I canâ€™t describe. 

I love beer. "

I typically drink dark beers. Porters, Stouts, Dark Amber Ales, things of that nature.

Is there any beer within these categories which you'd describe as having a touch of sweetness to it? Just a little bit of true sugar. Not an overly sweet fruity drink but something which is subtle. "

So long story short the brewery I work at here in NY has built a relationship with a professional soccer club in the UK including making licensed beers for them. We received an inquiry from someone on behalf of their ill father who happens to be from that town and is a huge fanatic of the club. They would love to get their hands on some of the beer for their ill father to try and we're trying to see how we can logistically get a 4-pack or two over to them. We're ok with a bit of cost within reason considering shipping will likely be ridiculous.

One of the things I had loved about Asheville and WNC was the abundance and diversity of the breweries. Big or small, corporate or quirky - always fun and willing to try new things. Known as ""Beer City"". The destruction from Helene and the water crisis have devastated the beer community from the largest to the smallest.

I heard that some are still trying to operate or are shifting production or are being creative to stay in business. 

How can we support those struggling to keep things flowing? I have mostly drank locally and want to continue to do that. Do some of the smaller breweries have outlets for product so that we can keep them going until better days. Love to know everyone's thoughts. Cheers."

Very, very old looking bottle design; not perfectly cylindrical, but wider and stouter. Bottle maybe had a little bit of embossed text?
The one we found was a dark beer, I want to say oat stout. From the UK. I believe the label said how it was brewed in an old church or at least used the well of an old church/abbey. These details keep turning up Sam Smith but that's not the one. Sam Smith has a cylindrical bottle and the label covers more of it. The fabled beer didn't have the yellow color scheme either. I'm fairly confident it was in fact from the UK and not a Belgian one but perhaps that's memory playing tricks.

I've read several previous posts for recommendations of places to go but was deciding how to divvy up my trip and how the time of the year might affect it. I am landing on Monday morning in Brussels and was thinking of hopping a train to Bruges right away to spend 2 nights there and then come back to Brussels for 3 nights. I'm taking a train to Frankfurt on Saturday so figured it would be best to do Brussels last. 

Are most places still open in December? Does the weather affect public transportation much? How difficult is it to get out to the Westvleteren cafe via public transportation? Any recommendations for places to visit otherwise are always appreciated as well. My sour tolerance is not what it once was so while I'll probably at least swing by Cantillon I will probably try to stick to the more funky and non-sour side of things.

About ten years ago I visited a winery that I learned about from BeerAdvocate, nice little place with a picnic area on top of a hill. They sold a beer/sparkling wine hybrid, I believe it had golden ale ingredients but was fermented with a champagne yeast. It was a corked and caged bottle, IIRC it had a standing frog on the label? I believe they shipped nation or state-wide and it was pretty popular at the time. I even took a bottle to-go that sat in my fridge for about a year. My Google-fu is failing me so if anyone has any recollection of what Iâ€™m talking about it would help greatly.

Edit: I just remembered that it was a Hefeweizen wine hybrid. It might have had some punny name like Hefe-wine?"

I come to you with a kind of peculiar question, since you lot seem to be the most knowledgeable with regards to that.
I have a dear friend who can, for allergy reasons, not drink wine in any form. However, she would really like to know what it tastes like/have at least an approximation. I want to help her out. I distinctly remember once drinking a beer called â€œNottinghamâ€ by Kehrwieder Kreativbrauerei from Hamburg â€“ while it definitely did not taste the same as wine, for someone who has never drunk any wine I would say it could be an okay approximation in a more interesting way than drinking, say, single-grape juice.
So my question to you: Did you lot ever have a barleywine that tasted a little bit/as close as possible to actual (red) wine? I would buy a Nottingham, but they do not seem to make it anymore. I am situated in Northern Germany, but for this special friend and project I would be ready to import a beer from anywhere.
Thanks a lot for your answers!"

So almost all are gone at this point. I do have  series of Stone Vertical Epic (2005-2012) left, and Iâ€™m trying to figure out what to do with them. 

Is there still interest in these? Are they worth selling as a set, or are they just past their prime ghosts that I should just drink and get rid of at this point?

For whatever reason they have the reputation of being an Australian beer when they're actually English I think. I like they because of the bulky size of their single cans, their good reliable malty tasty which I enjoyed many times while munching on countless Japanese style peanuts, and finally because I have a core memory associated with the beer.

I was during one of my college Summers my Dad flew me out to his apartment in Newcastle for an internship. It was an exciting time, but I was depressed in college and my parent's relationships were at a nadir, I wouldn't know it at the time but they'd eventually divorce.

Case in point it was a sad time in my life. When I finally reached his apartment I was so tired, a heavy, sleep deprived body tiredness. My Dad bought me the beer and brought me some wasabi flavored Japanese peanuts from Switzerland. They tasted amazing and the beer really helped me relax. I remember just sitting in his living room couch enjoying my ""dinner"" just before a nice warm shower. I wasn't watching anything on TV, just catching up with Dad.

Beer suggestions for an older neighbor?,2,1g8zvbr,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1g8zvbr/beer_suggestions_for_an_older_neighbor/,22,2024-10-22 03:26:55,"I know it is a very subjective question on which beer would a specific person like but Iâ€™m curious what others would suggest.
My fiancÃ© and his dad used to get a growler and beer for a long time neighbor every Halloween but his dad passed away earlier this year. We donâ€™t know the kind of beer his dad used to buy but we wanted to uphold the old tradition. 

We could ask, but we kind of want it to be a surprise since the tradition kind of fazed out after my father in law moved away and leaving us the house to live in. Also, itâ€™s become a little more rare seeing our neighbor outside and striking up a convo.

So of course this is purely subjective and can be a hit or miss, but Iâ€™m curious, what kind of beer would you suggest for a 70+ Midwestern man?

EDIT: Just thought Iâ€™d add; I know little to nothing about beer so hopefully this isnâ€™t a dumb question. But if itâ€™s not too dumb, any suggestions, whether itâ€™s different brands or types/ingredients, anything would be helpful!

EDIT 2: We ended up getting a decently well liked lager from a local brewery. Thank you so much for all of your suggestions and recommendations! "

   * *Cans win for outdoor adventures and stack easily, while bottles are heavier and breakable.*
* **Cost**: Cans 4/5, Bottles 2/5

I feel like Iâ€™m easing into my â€œCarlsbergâ€ years. I just want to stock my fridge with a 24 and not overthink it. Iâ€™m ready for a house beer.

The problem is, despite all the craft breweries around, Iâ€™m finding it hard to nail one down that fits my criteria, so Iâ€™m hoping for some help.

Hereâ€™s what I am looking for:
-available in 355cans or even better 341bottles.
-ideally available in bulk and not TOO expensive though that is relative and am willing to pay if needed
-ideally craft beer but Iâ€™m starting to think none will fit this bill so open to â€˜gaspâ€™ macro
-5%abv or less
-available in Ontario - and delivery across Ontario as Iâ€™m in Kingston

So far, Iâ€™ve tried
-Muskoka detour (not as good as it used to be. I had high hopes for this one but nope)
-lug lite (not off the table but not great)
-Muskoka tread lightly (loathed it)
-miller high life (sad to this this one is currently in the lead :()
-miller lite (tied with high life)
-side launch light lager (this one isnâ€™t bad)
-Modelo especial (donâ€™t like the beer but has a little skunk that is nostalgic which I kinda did)
-blood brothers blood light (this is my top beer from the category but get expensive since they donâ€™t sell by the case and need to pay shipping)
-Carlsberg (didnâ€™t try because you canâ€™t get in bottles anywhere around here)


On a side note: I LOATHE that every craft brewery is doing tall boys right now. IMHO if youâ€™re doing a light beer and putting it in tall boys youâ€™re doing it wrong. (I assume this was LCBOâ€™s doing so reckon they deserve the blame).

Before I had that when I was 21, I really only drank craft beers because they were stronger and could give you a good buzz faster (Victory Golden Monkey, Lagunitas Brown Shugga, Weyerbacher Merry Monks, etc). But I started reading around and trying new beers and styles for the fun of it, not just to get drunk. I'll always remember having Fuller's ESB for the first time. I was so amazed by the whole experience of how complex the malts were, how much I loved the fruity esters, and how the herbal hops used really balanced it all out. This was in around 2018-ish, and unfortunately since then so many English ales aren't available anymore. Fuller's ESB is gone. Hobgoblin ruby isn't available near me anymore. The more mass produced examples (which weren't really as good anyway) have also disappeared (red hook ESB, honker's ale etc).   


Last April I had the privelidge of going to NERAX (New England Real Ale Exhibiton) and got to try so many cask ales from the UK and US. I'm 27, but I felt like a baby there with the average age probably being in the mid-to-late 40s. It was fascinating to learn how influential British beer styles and brewing culture were to the early craft beer movement in the US. Now, coming upon a British style at a store or a brewery is extemely uncommon. 

  
My question is this. Right now in the US, lagers are making a huge comeback as people are looking for something drinkable and lower ABV that is sessionable. Why aren't British styles a part of this resurgence? They are often even lower in ABV than many lager styles, and are often much more complex and interesting. From an economic standpoint, I believe they are also cheaper to brew as they do not require extended storage. What gives? What's stopping these amazing styles from becoming more of a staple in the craft beer scene in the US?"

Picture this. Ontario. 1988.

Iâ€™m a 9 year old boy. My dad leaves the room, and I take a sip of his beer. Itâ€™s gross. I hate it. But the taste makes an imprint.

Skunky. A bit vegetal.

I grew up, got into craft beer. IPAs, DIPAs, Imperial Stouts, sours.

All great - but Iâ€™ve still yet to taste that taste that I remember.

The closest was a Pacifico on vacation once. But I canâ€™t get that in Ontario.

The only clue I have is that I know my dad drank Oâ€™keefe at one point. But I canâ€™t get that here.

I imagine itâ€™s a taste found in macro beer? Iâ€™ve tried a couple with no luck. I tried Miller Lite and it had a hint of it in the first sip but then it disappeared.

So, I guess Iâ€™m wondering, what beers should I try that might have that nostalgic, skunky, mildly vegetal 80s dad beer taste? Know what I mean?"

My mom had a regular 12oz bottle of MHL in her fringe for months and didnâ€™t have any other beer so I took it upon myself to drink it and it tasted awful. Wasnâ€™t very bubbly for being the champagne of beers and had an extremely sweet corn syrupy flavor to it. I ended up only drinking half of it and havenâ€™t had it again until this week.

Earlier this week I was dying for a beer and was a day away from payday so I settled for a $1.69 32 oz bottle of Miller Highlife and it was so good I had to go by three more today. Perfect balance of light and flavorful. Easily chuggable and pleasantly sippable.

My question is, has any of you noticed MHL tasting better out of the big bottles as opposed to the standard 12oz variety? Or was the one in my momâ€™s fridge just too old? Iâ€™ve finished all three and have yet to taste that offputting sweet corn syrupy note."

From Burial Brewing: How to support Asheville after Helene,143,1fv9k0w,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1fv9k0w/from_burial_brewing_how_to_support_asheville/,12,2024-10-03 21:49:55,"Hi everybody -

The team at Burial Brewing in Asheville has been feeding the community and directing folks to fundraisers as they recover from the catastrophic flooding of Hurricane Helene (I know others like DSSOLVR are helping, but they're who I follow on Instagram). I emailed them to see if I could donate to them to help them with their efforts, and [as promised](https://old.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1fu4fei/asheville_breweries_devastated_by_helene_flooding/lq2fzz1/), here's the email I received:

---

Good Morning Folks,

I want to start by saying thank you to each of you who reached out to offer support. Itâ€™s been overwhelming to keep up with in the best possible way. Hearing from you is keeping us optimistic and moving forward. Iâ€™d also like to thank you for your patience as we tried to wrap our heads around where and how to direct these offers.

Weâ€™ve spent the past few days sorting through the abundance of information thatâ€™s out there and have settled on the following as a start.

**For those looking to support Asheville and WNC:**

* **Overview** - These three resources below have been the most reliable and all-encompassing that we have found so far:

**For those looking to support Burial Beer Co.:**

* **Overview** - As of Tuesday, October 1st, we have been in contact with 100% of Burial's Asheville Staff. Everyone is safe and accounted for. We're considering ourselves incredibly lucky that our Asheville locations did not sustain any major damage. Unfortunately, many of our friends and neighbors cannot say the same. Our timeline on reopening any Burial AVL locations will largely rely on the city's ability to re-establish a potable and running water supply, which we've heard may take weeks and up to months. That being said, our main focus right now is supplying hot meals, cold water, dry goods, feminine products, gas, and electricity to both our staff and the community.
* **Physical Donations** -
Both our Charlotte and Raleigh Taprooms are accepting donations that will be delivered to our South Slope Asheville Taproom. Additionally, UPS and FedEx have resumed service to Asheville. If you're interested and able to send dry goods, feminine products, or bottled water, our address is:
  * [40 Collier Ave, Asheville, NC 28801](https://www.google.com/maps/search/40+Collier+Ave,+Asheville,+NC+28801?entry=gmail&source=g)
* **Volunteering** -
We are thankful to have the resources on our staff to handle our limited Asheville operations at the moment. For those of you looking to volunteer, we'd like to direct you to: volunteer@buncombecounty.org.
* **Financial Support** -
  * [GoFundMe for Asheville Hospitality Staff](https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-asheville-coworkers-in-recovery-together) - Our Charlotte Taproom Manager, Alissa Gavin, has created a fund that will benefit our AVL Bartenders and Kitchen Employees currently unable to work. 
  * [Charlotte](https://burialbeer.com/pages/charlotte-house-of-relics) & [Raleigh](https://burialbeer.com/pages/raleigh-the-exhibit) Taprooms - Both locations are currently open with standard operations. Come say hi to our teams, enjoy some pours, and take some beer to-go.
  * [Online Shop](https://burialbeer.com/pages/delivery-asheville-pickup) - Our Online Shop for Beer and Merchandise Shipping is active. We're working to catch up on orders received during the storm, as well as the new orders coming in each day. Shipping will likely be a bit slower than you're used to from us, but we will get you the goods as soon as we possibly can.
I know this is a lot, but please let me know if you have any questions. I will do my best to get back to everyone as quickly as possible.


Thank you,
The Burial Beer Co. Team"

ColdFire Brewingâ€™s â€œFlavor Policeâ€ â€“ A Rant About Customer Choice and Brewery Elitism,0,1fv2ccb,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1fv2ccb/coldfire_brewings_flavor_police_a_rant_about/,34,2024-10-03 14:36:25,"Iâ€™ve got to say, Iâ€™ve had some great times at ColdFire Brewing Company in Eugene, Oregon. They make solid beer, and Iâ€™ve enjoyed supporting a local spot. But tonight? They really lost me with one of the most pretentious policies Iâ€™ve ever come across in any brewery.

Iâ€™ve been to breweries all over the country and made the same simple request at all of them: half IPA, half cider. I like the sweetness of the cider mixed with the hoppiness of the IPAâ€”itâ€™s a combo that works for me. But apparently, ColdFire doesnâ€™t care what its customers like. When I ordered this, the server told me itâ€™s company policy not to honor requests like this because (Iâ€™m paraphrasing here), the brewers work â€œreally hardâ€ to create flavor profiles, and customers need to â€œhonor that.â€ Yeah, really.

What? I thought I walked into a brewery, not the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld. â€œNo mixed drinks for you!â€ I made that exact comparison to the server, who looked at me like Iâ€™d just insulted their entire family. Seriously, though, the snobby disdain in the response was just off-putting.

And hereâ€™s the thing: Iâ€™ve never had a pub, bar, or brewery deny this simple request, which Iâ€™ve made dozens of times over many years at all kinds of places. But ColdFire? Theyâ€™re so wrapped up in their self-importance that they actually enforce this ridiculous policy, as if theyâ€™re doing us a favor by refusing what we like.

And letâ€™s get one thing straightâ€”denying a customerâ€™s requestâ€”even if it seems a bit weirdâ€”should NEVER be a company policy at a food and beverage establishment or anywhere in the service industry. The customerâ€™s preferences reign supreme, especially over the pride and ego of the chefs or, in this case, the brewers. Customers come to enjoy themselves, not be told their tastes are wrong.

FOOD AND DRINK IS PERSONAL. What tastes good to one person might taste like absolute trash to another. People alter their food and drinks to suit their own tastes all the time. Imagine a steakhouse refusing to give you salt because â€œthe chef seasoned it to perfection,â€ or an ice cream shop rejecting your request for two different flavors because â€œour chef determined those donâ€™t go together.â€ Itâ€™s absurd, right? But here we are.

ColdFire, youâ€™ve officially become one of the most pretentious and out-of-touch establishments in Eugene. Congratulations. Newsflash: customers come to enjoy themselves, not to bow down to some snobby, self-important idea of what â€œshouldâ€ be good. And the fact that Iâ€™ve never had a single other place deny this request? That just makes your policy all the more ridiculous.

So, has anyone else had this experience? Is this really the hill ColdFire wants to die on? Curious to hear if this is a one-off or if other people have noticed a shift in the customer experience here. Also curious if anyone knows the name of the owner(s)."

Port strikes and beer imports.,4,1fux5kd,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1fux5kd/port_strikes_and_beer_imports/,10,2024-10-03 09:04:02,"https://www.benzinga.com/news/global/24/10/41148694/beer-shortage-ahead-3-products-that-will-be-most-impacted-by-port-strike

> These are the sectors that could be the most impacted by the strike:

> Food and Beverage: The dozen or so U.S. ports affected by the strike import nearly $100 million a month of beverages and vinegar, according to a report from the Washington Post. According to the American Farm Bureau Federation via the Washington Post, 80% of all imported beer, whiskey, scotch and more come through the ports will be impacted by the strike.

> Constellation Brands. The maker of Modelo, is one of the companies that imports the most beer to the U.S., although Constellation may be able to avoid disruptions caused by the port through ground transportation from Mexico. Heineken NV and other European beverage companies may feel more of the strikeâ€™s affects.

The longshoreman strikes on the East Coast may cause the prices on imported beer, wine, and spirits to increase, as well as supply to decrease.  Some of the more popular imported brands like Modelo, Corona, Guinness and Heineken may see price increases and be harder to find.  If you regularly drink imported beer, you may want to stock up in case prices increase."
Did you know that the Ancient Egyptians celebrated the â€œFestival of Drunkennessâ€? ,32,1fur938,https://aleaffair.com/who-made-the-first-beer/#The_Festival_of_Drunkeness,7,2024-10-03 04:13:23,"According to legend, Ra (the Sun god) sent the goddess Sekhmet to punish humanity, but she went on a destructive rampage.

The Egyptians celebrated this with the Festival of Drunkenness,where they drank until they passed out. Can we revive this festival, please?

Do you think it's safe to tap this upcoming Friday(So the beer would be 14 days tapped)? I'm not as concerned with taste, after all, it is keg beer, more with general safety.

So as of last Friday, Iâ€™m now 21!!! To be honest for a second, Iâ€™ve had some beers here or there in the last year at family get togethers and parties with friends.

I want to see whatâ€™s out there in the beer world, try a little bit of everything I suppose! If it helps, the beers Iâ€™ve had so far are as follows:

-Bud Light
-Samuel Adams (Oktoberfest, Winter Lager, Summer Ale)
-Corona 
- Blue Moon

Given the ones I listed, I really enjoyed the Samuel Adams flavors the most. Blue Moon being second place, Corona third, and Bud Light being last. Thatâ€™s not because I donâ€™t like it, it just doesnâ€™t excite my palate much.

The other day, we were canning Cuba Libre, and something happened with the carbonation. Everything was measured using a c-DGM Gehaltemeter Haffmans CO2/O2, calibrated and clean:

* Carbonation in the BBT: 2.71 vol.
* Carbonation inline, at the filler inlet: 2.70 vol.
* Carbonation in the cans (average of 35 cans): 2.14 vol.

The cans were randomly selected from the packaging line and refrigerated until they reached an approximate temperature of 32-33 Â°F.

My question is the following: during the measurement, if I didnâ€™t fully open the flow on the equipment, the temperature didnâ€™t drop enough, showing a higher reading (the liquid was about 33 Â°F, but the equipment read 37 Â°F). For this type of product, where Iâ€™m only measuring CO2, what is the correct procedure? (I've never got this kind of problems with the beer, so, im asking for RTD).  Should I fully open the flow until the measurement stabilizes? If so, why does the pressure drop so much, and consequently the carbonation, when there was no breakout or foaming during filling?

Additionally, could it be that the CO2 loss is happening during filling and not due to incorrect measurement? Since this beverage has no proteins (unlike beer, which does allow CO2 retention), would it be advisable to add some additive to improve foam retention in the liquid? Thanks any comment is welcome!"

I'm a Belgian visiting London soon, so I'm looking for some beer recommendations.

Those include Rochefort 10, Gouden Carolus Imperial Dark, Chimay Bleu, Gulden Draak Classic, Sint-Bernardus Abt 12 and my absolute favourite : Kasteel Donker. 

I've been doing some research online, and it has lead me to things like milk stout, oatmeal stout, tropical stout and honey beer. I have to admit that I've ignored stout beers due to disliking Guinness. But apparently that's an imperial stout? The guesthouse I'm staying at is above an Irish pub, so I'm assuming they'll have quite a few stouts for me to try.

My current ""list"" of beers to try (or bring with me) consists of only 2 beers atm : Left Hand Nitro Milk Stout and Samuel Smith oatmeal stout. I'd love to expand this list with some other sweet British beers. Doesn't necessarily have to be stout.

After the 16th century, beers began to regularly include this ingredient. For years, only a mixture of herbs and spices was used to slightly alter its flavor, around the 1100s AD.

The nun **Hildegard von Bingen** (1098-1179), in a German monastery, wrote a treatise on the benefits of hops, beer, and the use of hops in it. Based on the fact that sweet drinks were heavily consumed, which led to vision problems and blindness, Hildegard suggested that the bitterness of beer counteracted the overconsumption of such beverages.

Thanks to Hildegard, hops were identified as growing in the chapel of Bavaria and became recognized as a key ingredient in beer. It wasnâ€™t until 1400 that hops reached the Netherlands, and in 1519 it was condemned as a bad herb. Not until the 16th century was it included as a basic ingredient."

Canadian Beer Drinkers: Beware of Imports Brewed Under Contract.,0,1fo36yx,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1fo36yx/canadian_beer_drinkers_beware_of_imports_brewed/,45,2024-09-24 10:25:24,"Miller Lite shouldnâ€™t be that difficult to copy. Yet it tastes like Molson. The Wisconsin Miller Lite has a very distinct pils nose and flavor.

Guinness Extra Stout. Itâ€™s %0.4 weaker than the Irish version. It lacks body, flavor, and is fizzy as if thereâ€™s zero nitro in it. Nitro or not itâ€™s just way more fizzy and empty tasting.

Grolsch. Honestly itâ€™s been awhile since I drank an original. But this is flabby and barely palatable. It should be a little more hop sharp and slightly sea sprayâ€™esque.

The problem here is if youâ€™ve never experienced the originals you either like the under contract versions for what they are or you donâ€™t. And I think that Molson and maybe a little less so Labatt, have always wanted to homogenize and lower the expectations of the beer drinking experience.

Or perhaps this is a result of their vertical integration of procuring grains and hops, combined with their standardized brewing process.

Either way Iâ€™m done with these companies. If you agree contact your local convenience stores and grocery to pressure them to have variety."

I've listed a few I found below: 

- New Belgium Brewing (Colorado, USA):Â This brewery is a pioneer in the sustainable beer movement. They run on 100% wind power, have an impressive water conservation system, and even use a methane-powered co-gen engine to turn waste into energy. Plus, they're a certified B Corporation, which is always good!

- Camden Town Brewery (Camden Town, London):Â Despite supporting the worst team in North London, Camden Town Brewery is dedicated to sustainability, using 100% renewable electricity, recycling brewing waste, and minimising material use in packaging. They also conserve water and collaborate with local farmers and a UK charity to reduce environmental impact.

- Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. (California, USA):Â Known for their zero-waste initiative, Sierra Nevada recycles or reuses nearly 100% of their waste. They've also invested heavily in solar energy and have one of the largest privately-owned solar arrays in the U.S. Their commitment to water conservation and sustainable agriculture is also top-notch.

- To Ã˜l (Copenhagen, Denmark):Â To Ã˜l operates out of a facility they've dubbed ""To Ã˜l City,"" which is all about zero-waste and circular economy principles. They're using local, organic ingredients and innovative packaging solutions that make their operations as sustainable as possible.

What other sustainable breweries do you know of? Before anyone mentions BrewDog, please do look at the shit show that company has become. "

I am in Saigon Vietnam now and grabbed a few Asahis at 7-11 but the moment I took a sip from the first one, I knew something was off.  Not only did it not taste the same, but I have never tasted a beer that tasted like some sort of chemical in my entire life.  It was very pronounced.  I cracked open another one and same thing.  I asked my wife to take a sip and she immediately agreed something is way off.  I then inspected the can and it said this on the side. 

â€œby Shenzhen Tsingtao Beer
Asahi Breweries, Ltd., Tokyoâ€
www.asahisuperdry.com

I assumed it was from Japan, but I guess it is a Chinese brewed one, but why so different and why such an awful chemical taste?  Surely Asahi has quality control?  What could have caused this?  Left in the hot sun?  Did I drink a fake beer?   Has anyone had this experience with other beers?  

Also, unsure if related, but about an hour after having those sips (maybe 2 oz/60ml total) my toes on both my feet suddenly curled up with the most intense cramp I have ever experienced and it took 30 mins of massage and hot water to calm them down. I rarely get cramped toes and never for more than a second or two on one foot so this was a big surprise.  So much so that it has me wondering if that beer was poison in some way?  I looked into causes of extreme toe cramps and the only possible thing that jumped out was poisoning as there was no other cause that rang as even possible.  

Will post on a Vietnam subreddit as maybe the locals have some insights.

For non-Colorado beers I've really enjoyed Dominiga's paloma sour, Voodoo Ranger, and Duvel. My favorite overall though has to be Pilsner Urquell (a bit biased towards it as I'm learning Czech). Any recommendations based on these? I'm basically open to anything as I'm still seeing what I like"

My favorite is Colt .45, it's just so smooth and silky, slight sweetness, but still malty, almost like drinking a bowl of cereal. I think the taste is superior to Mickey's, and it hits smoother than Olde English, Steele Reserve, and Cobra; in that it doesn't get you drunk off the second sip.

The price is still cheaper than water, and has a good kick, without making you gag as it doesn't taste like IPAs."

All there was was bottled beers (or canned) which You'd get at shops, and they were just... what I'd call Â« regular Â» beers. No hops.

But then all of a sudden (well, if You can call a decade or couple of decades as Â« sudden Â»), suddenly hops everywhere. And specialty beers, and bars that make their special beers, etc. And it seems to Me that this happened quite all over the world. Again : IPAs, APAs, ales, hops and hops.

Recommendations wanted,4,1fgrifz,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1fgrifz/recommendations_wanted/,5,2024-09-15 00:36:03,"So Iâ€™ve tried to get into beers/ciders since college (now in my 30s) and I just canâ€™t seem to find something. I used to drink Reddâ€™s Apple Ale, but now I donâ€™t even enjoy that.
Iâ€™m not looking to get tanked, Iâ€™m just looking for something nice to sip on after work. 
Iâ€™ve done some online research for about 2 weeks now, and have gone and done a pick your own 6pack from the local store.
The only thing Iâ€™ve liked so far is Angry Orchard cider, and thatâ€™s after letting it go semi-flat. 
I donâ€™t like a heavy or overpowering wheat flavor, Iâ€™m a fan of sour/fruity, but flavor matters to me way more than it probably should. 

Drinks Iâ€™ve tried so far:
Shock Top
Lazy Hiker IPA
Sam Adams Cherry Wheat (smelled great tasted awful)
Angry Orchard (liked)
Heineken (didnâ€™t enjoy, but didnâ€™t hate)
Bud light "
CO2/Keg advice,3,1fgr3vn,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1fgr3vn/co2keg_advice/,4,2024-09-15 00:17:58,"Hello. I am having a problem with my new keg setup and Iâ€™m having trouble finding anyone with a similar issue online. 

I got this set up a month ago. Two sixel kegs in a kegerator hooked up to two taps. I have attached a 5 lb CO2 tank to the kegs. 

For the first week it ran no problems. The pours were foamy but after fiddling with the pressure levels I got it pouring well. Then the CO2 tank ran out with both kegs still about half full. I rubbed soap on all the points of escape and found a leak, applied sealant to it and it stopped leaking there. Hooked up a new tank and it poured well, but less than a week later, same problem. The kegs were empty now, replaced them, hooked up a new tank and couldnâ€™t find another leak. 

This is the part where Iâ€™m not finding anyone with the same issue. I followed some instructions I found online:

1. pressurize the regulator until the low pressure gauge is reading 10 psi

2. close the valve between the regulator and the hose and shut off the tank 

The instructions said the pressure should stay the same. What happened was they stayed the same for two minutes, then quickly increased to 25 psi, before suddenly dropping to zero. I tried this twice and the same thing happened each time. 

This is a full tank of CO2 and when I set everything up normally it is pouring beer out of both taps no issue, but I am confused about why my tanks are going empty so fast. 

Has anyone had an issue like this before? Iâ€™m thinking I may need to replace the regulator? Iâ€™m not sure what other troubleshooting to do and I want advice from people more experienced than me before I spend more money on this thing. 

Thank you. "

I planned on getting some cheap insulated jackets for them and I want to get two containers I can set them in and fill will ice. They'll be inside the venue for the reception.

I see a keg is about 16"" diameter and I'm seeing containers that are a 17.5"" width. Do I need something wider? Taller? What would you recommend? I'm picking them up from a local bar, and the guy said he would keep them in the 40 degree cooler in the back for me with their other kegs, do I even need the insulated jackets?

I'm looking for advice...

I am looking to add 6 new draught keg beer lines to my licensed premesis which I own freehold. Currently there is no celllar and I have no taps.

I have all planning and licensing in order for a new cellar area and 6 lines, the cellar being behind the current bar (under 5 meters from keg to tap in a straight line) I am very capable doing any building out work, drilling walls for trunking, connecting things up ect.

However my knowledge of how to design this system is limited to speaking with equipment suppliers and reading/watching websites/YouTube.

At the moment Im thinking I could have a stab at creating this system, buying and installing the parts myself. However I'm concerned I may hit pitfalls or poorly design it. 

I will not be doing the phyiaical cellar room build or the electrics/cellar cooling myself. I am only considering creating the keg draught system.

Is there any good information/resources/recommend training you can share given the above.

If I'm way off the mark and I'm crazy to even attempt it, please let me know aswell.

Thank you.

i get it, i really do -- a bad beer is a bad beer. but if i crack open a beer, i'm not going to stop drinking it even if i hate it. especially because some beers taste different from first sip to last. but I'm okay with not drinking the rest of them, it's just wanting to finish what I've started.....

First, is it even reasonable to try and visit places in both countries over the span of around a week? Or would we be better off to just stick to one country? We do on average prefer German styles more and so if it's not reasonable to do both, we would probably stick with Germany. 

  
Second, what cities and breweries would you recommend visiting? This [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/s83g8a/beer_pilgrimage_with_my_dad_to_germany_belgium/) had some great answers, but it's two years old and so I thought maybe there may some more newer answers.

PSA for Guinness drinkers: Guinness seems to keep extending their $5 rebate program,101,1fammom,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1fammom/psa_for_guinness_drinkers_guinness_seems_to_keep/,23,2024-09-07 01:43:02,"I've been using this for maybe a year or so now. While it used to be seasonal.... it seems they're currently keeping this going indefinitely as it's now been extended until the end of the year. To me, Guinness is a great session beer that is widely available, but my main complaint has always been that it's just a touch too expensive for what it is. This rebate knocks it down to the $1 per 12oz territory (if you're buying the nitro 8 packs), which is pretty great (it's about $15-16 at my grocery store).

I buy Guinness semi-regularly so I've been taking full advantage. The money is typically venmoed to you in a few days.  I think there's a limit of 4 uses per month per person.

The year of Festbier (In America)?,51,1f9w6ji,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1f9w6ji/the_year_of_festbier_in_america/,51,2024-09-06 03:12:09,"Just checking out my local total wine and their OFest selections, after having the hardest time last year finding any festbier (literally just one single variety) this year I count at least 6. Sierra Nevadaâ€™s selection this year is a festbier as well. Is this the year it finally makes it big in America alongside the traditional MÃ¤rzen?

For the unaware, there are two styles of German Oktoberfest bier. In America, we generally only see the older style called MÃ¤rzen, which is an amber very malty style that was traditionally aged half a year (hence the name. Most is not aged nowadays and the flavor is achieved via other means though some still age theirs). 

The more modern variant is known as festbier and is somewhere in between a MÃ¤rzen and a standard helles lager. Malty, slightly hoppy, easy drinking with a surprising kick of alcohol. It was generally very hard to find in the US outside of certain imports, compared to MÃ¤rzen. "

Also fake brands. I understand Madri is British but has a Spanish identity. Ive even heard a rumour it uses a recipe extremely close to Carling Black Label and is just a pure marketing ploy."

Let's define commonly as being able to reliably find a pub with real ale in any city. Real ale is defined as ""Beer brewed from traditional ingredients, matured by secondary fermentation in the container from which it is dispensed, and served without the use of extraneous carbon dioxide."" by Wiktionary.

The reason why I ask is that I love bitter but will probably have to leave the UK for some years at least to pursue a career in academia.

Edit: some confusion about real ale vs ale. Real ale is a subset of ale. It has been pointed out to me that a better word to use might be cask beer. I'm not asking where you can get any ale because Guinness is ubiquitous but not what I want."

So after some discussion the wife and I decided to open one and try it. Really how bad can a 30 year old beer be?  Well to me it had a strong aroma of alcohol, maybe like a port wine,  it looked like used motor oil in the glass.  It had left some funky brown deposits on the blue glass bottle.  I tried it and immediately thought of a port wine that is starting to turn, I would drink it in small quantities.  Maybe a addition to some winter cocktail creation.  The wife's reaction is a bit more intense, I really wish I could post a photo of the face she made.  The works out her mouth were ""yuck, rancid, how the hell can you drink that"".

My next thought was to try a triple bock spriz.  presico,  triple bock and club soda. Maybe that would help.

Maybe as a base or beer bread?

Clicked every link on google, scoured ebay, even called multiple liquor stores within 100 miles of my area to no avail. 

My boyfriend is British. He went to England last year to visit family, and drank his fair share (a lot, as he should) of good British beer. And ever since then he has been RAVING about John Smithâ€™s Extra Smooth Ale. 

He will only drink Boddingtons and Belhaven Scottish Ale/Belhaven Black Stout now, with the occasional FORGD Stout or Guinness Draught at the bar or when a restaurant wonâ€™t let you BYO. But he says nothing comes close to the taste of authentic John Smithâ€™s from his dadâ€™s hometown in England. 

Is it sold in the U.S. at all? I live in New Jersey, between the Newark-Trenton area. Iâ€™m willing to pay $200 to get him as much as I can as a Christmas gift. 

If not, how would I go about importing it? Itâ€™s for personal use, obviously, but would I need a permit or documents for it? I found a 24 pack on a site called McGrocer that says it can ship to the U.S. via UPS, but I donâ€™t want to buy it and have it seized by customs if thereâ€™s something else I need to do to get it here. 

In the meantime, what would be a good substitute that I can recommend to him? Basically the closest to the Extra Smooth Ale that you can get in the U.S.?

Anything helps!!!

EDIT: I FOUND IT!

So it definitely is not found in the states, you guys were right about that. But I did some research on just importing it and it was so much easier than I thought. I went with that company that I mentioned before, McGrocer. I was able to (very expensively) ship a case of 18 cans from the UK to the U.S. for a whopping Â£91.36 (or about $135 at the time I ordered it). All I had to do was email them a picture of my ID to validate that I was of legal age in the U.S. to purchase alcohol, and they sent it right to my door. No import hassle whatsoever. Itâ€™s hiding safely under my bed out of sight from my man until Christmas. Cannot wait to see the look on his face when he realizes he can have a taste of the place he loves most whenever he wants (up to 18 cans of it). Thanks for all the suggestions, I really appreciate it!"

Iâ€™ve been sampling cask ales around town (Stockholm) and so far been let down. Right now Iâ€™m trying Timothy Taylorâ€™s Boltmaker (tried Knowle Spring Blonde too) from a reputable bar (it has the â€œCask Marqueâ€ certification and a Timothy Taylor Champion Club plaque)

To me, the beer is slightly too warm (not cold enough), slightly too flat, and lacking anything that stands out flavor wise. I get that the point is for it to be this way, but the only substance Iâ€™m getting is a tea like astringency. A little dusty. 

The only one Iâ€™ve liked decent was a darker mild; it felt more appropriate for a darker beer, creamier, smooth. 

I respect these bars so maybe itâ€™s just a me thing. I havenâ€™t traveled to the UK and wonâ€™t give up yet. But for now Iâ€™d prefer the beer on normal draft. "

Best Hefeweizens?,4,1exes97,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1exes97/best_hefeweizens/,13,2024-08-21 09:53:34,"What do you think are the best Hefeweizens? 

I never really got into beer until I visited Munich in 2015. Since then, Hefeweizens have been my go to beers. I've tried several, and here is my take.

Weihenstephan - this is the one where I notice variations from batch to batch, so it's a bit or miss for me. I've noticed that some have a stronger note of clove, and I really don't like them. The ones I've gotten that had strong banana note, I think are the best I've had. But again, it's inconsistent in my opinion, so it's not my go to.

KÃ¶nig Ludwig Weissbier- it's been a few years since I've had it, so I can't really comment on specifics, but I know that it's probably almost my favorite or at least top 3

Franziskaner- I don't think it's quite as good as the  best weihenstephans or Ludwig's ive had, but it's very consistent, and (at least for me) easy to find. I'd describe this one as a more bready taste.

I had some of the Hofbrau Hefeweizen last week, it was pretty good, but seemed a bit more bitter than other Hefeweizens.

Ive probably tried the Hefeweizens from most or all of the Munich breweries, but none of them were memorable enough for me to comment on or good enough for me to have continue purchasing.

What are your favorite Hefeweizens?"

One commentor mentioned itâ€™s

El Guapo has a translucent, burnt-orange appearance, with a thin, off-white head and a bit of lacing. The aroma is of rich, dark bread crust and a possible agave touch. The flavor is of white bread crust and noticeable and unusual bitterness. El Guapo has a medium body and a mostly-dry finish."

Make canned beer more enjoyable ,0,1eumnja,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1eumnja/make_canned_beer_more_enjoyable/,22,2024-08-18 00:07:05,"I was looking at different ways to make canned beer taste better. There are always those people at the bar that add a pinch of salt to ""enhance"" flavors or to make it less flat - IMO I'm not a fan.

Just with a quick google search, [Guinness Nitrosurge | Official Global Site](https://nitrosurge.guinness.com/en/), seems to have a device for specialty beer cans. However, you have to use special cans that are not sold in the US. IMO their US canned beer is nothing like what you get in Ireland, so if this works it would be revolutionary.

Then there are also the machines (like [Amazon.com : Chill-O-Matic Instant Beverage Cooler. You can Chill a 12 Ounce Can of Beer or Soda in just 60 Seconds with This Portable Cooling Device : Home & Kitchen](https://www.amazon.com/Chill-Matic-Automatic-Beverage-Chiller/dp/B01DFPM5PE?th=1)) that get your beer ice cold. This maybe a bigger deal for light beer.

This leads to canned Hazy IPA. These are really impacted by the time they sit on a shelf. I was wondering with the beer expects on this sub: is there are any other ways to make these canned beers taste more consistent?

Other than those above and besides tapping a keg, is there anything I'm missing?"

Got home to put it in the fridge and noticed the date printed on it was two months out. I know some breweries will print a can date vs an expiration date, but after a quick search apparently Goose Island prints expiration dates. So I went back to the store and showed them the date on the box, and they told me I was wrong and that was the can date, and the expiration date was the one next to it. The serial code. If that were the case it would have expired on December 9th, 2002 even though it was canned on June 24th, 2024. Apparently they think beer retro-expires and they wouldnâ€™t have it, and not wanting to start an argument, I just took it and left. Even if it was December 2024, I would think hop character would significantly degrade in that amount of time. Obviously 5 or 6 month old (from the actual can date) beer wonâ€™t hurt you, but Iâ€™m a little salty they sold me a likely stale 6 pack. Oh well, itâ€™s 7% so itâ€™ll still get me buzzed lmao.

We want alcohol at our wedding, but figured we either need to have a ticketing system (yuck) or stick to beer and wine (better). We do have a bartender, but the venue does not supply any alcohol.

I suppose my questions are these:

1. Is there a better approach?
2. If not, we figured \~20-30 bottles of wine for \~150 people. How many cans of beer should we get?
3. (not really a beer drinker) What types of beer should we get? 2-4 different types?
4. Are seltzers a good compromise?

Most have been in Indiana but I've also done some of the touristy ones (Anheuser, Guinness, etc.). They're all pretty much the same. ""Here are the ingredients in beer. Here's a mash tun. Here's a canning line."" You know the drill. 

I'll be traveling to Denver in a few weeks and was hoping someone had experience with a truly great/unique brewery tour in the area. I have been to Denver once as an adult. Only drank at a couple of places and toured O'Dell in Ft. Collins. I tend to drink with the season (more pales in the summer, stouts in the winter), but am an equal opportunity embiber. Input is appreciated."

Why do all beers to me have a metallic bitter aftertaste?,0,1emmslz,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1emmslz/why_do_all_beers_to_me_have_a_metallic_bitter/,46,2024-08-08 03:42:02,"I have only tried a few beers in my life, but always, after having a refreshing sip of this fermented liquid where CO2 gives a fizzy sensation, the consequences occur right after swallowing it. It leaves my mouth feeling dry with a bitter tone, almost as a metallic taste if it can be said so.

Should I be drinking more beer to acquire a bigger tolerance to this sensation? I do fine with alcohol but the taste of beer I find offsetting. I'd like to enjoy it but this turns drinking beer as a challenge rather than a pleasure."

Boy were we wrong.

Almost every pub we visited in London and Edinburgh had multiple options. Most times each new pub would have one or two she hadn't seen yet. On top of that, some places had a non-alcoholic on draught which she was incredibly excited to see (I think it was Lucky Saint that was on draft the few times we saw this).

This allowed her to pub crawl with me and have as much fun with it as I did.

It was really impressive to see how many options there were. Hopefully we see those types of options here in the states soon, especially a draught option here and there."

I don't know how to describe it either or what other people call it. I guess it kinda reminds me of white bread or flour or something, but also not quite. Here's some beers I've noticed this flavour in:

- Weihenstephaner & Erdinger Hefeweizen

- Weihenstephaner Dunkelweizen

- Texels Skuumkoppe

- Grolsch Lager

- Weihenstephaner Original Helles

I know this is painfully little to go off of, as I have no idea how to describe the flavour, but I figured it's worth a shot."

I really want to make a shandy at home similar to what you get in a pun but I am not sure what beer/lager they actually use in a pub.

So far I have been using Coors with lemonade as that is all they had available whilst I was on holiday, but I have became a bit too prone to the taste of Coors now and the lemonade just overpowers it. It is no longer giving me that refreshing taste!

If not is there another common beer I can run on the same gas? (In the US, canâ€™t order Kilkenny)

For my go-to's it's the Long Trail Survival Pack for local craft breweries and the Guinness Pub Pack for the macro's. The Survival Pack is changed seasonally between summer, fall and winter with the line up changing. So the current one in stores is the winter one which nets you standard Long Trail, VT IPA, Limbo IPA and Hibernator Scottish Ale. 12 beers for the standard cost of about 16 bucks (prices vary a lot depending on where you get it) is pretty alright as far as craft brews go. The Guinness Pub Pack is sold at a discount beer store currently for about 16 bucks, gets you 15 cans split between normal Guinness, Harp Lager and Smithwick Red. There's better dry stouts, pale lagers and red ales but imo none are as affordable or as available as Guinness so it's a good buy for me."

Iâ€™ve been paying more attention to the can pressure since an obviously skunked pack I got a bit ago that was â€œfreshâ€ straight from a brewery nearby. Does anyone else do this or am I maybe judging the freshness wrong?


Edit - I guess my main question would be do different kinds of beers get different levels of carbonation? Iâ€™m a beer drinker, not brewer."

Why Draft Beer Drinking Is in Decline | Bon AppÃ©tit,53,1gs2yj1,https://www.bonappetit.com/story/draft-beer-decline,145,2024-11-16 01:22:09,"I have a feeling that higher prices have a lot to do with this. 

When I was in my 20s in Manhattan I didn't want to pay $7+ dollars for a ""pint"". One of the reasons I moved to Portland, OR is that I could get a pint for $5. Not anymore. 

Now I'm in my 40s and I still don't like spending $7 for a 'pint' in Portland. "
Pilsner Urquell guy back again ðŸ¤—,1,1gs4wsg,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1gs4wsg/pilsner_urquell_guy_back_again/,0,2024-11-16 02:46:05,"So we can say, I am just starting to enjoy beer. The taste, the â€œhoppynesâ€ (hope I spelt that right), the bitter aftertaste etcâ€¦.

I drank a lot of it, that for sure. But I have never appreciated good beer. I used to drink beer to get drunk, now I drink it because I enjoy it so much. 

The different experience you get with every different one, tasting the difference between canned, bottled and kegs. Donâ€™t get me wrong, itâ€™s a really nice feeling to get a bit tipsy after work, but that not the goal anymore. 

So, today I went into the local liquor store to get a tap for my Zahringer keg (not in production anymore, but for how cheap it was, man is it good from a keg) that my friend gave me who has a bar at home. 

Anyways, I found a really good deal. For 2,5 litres of bottled Pilsner Urquell and a Pilsner glass (jug? how do you call a beer bottle, English is not my specialty after drinking hahahah) I paid 8 fucking Euros. 8. And itâ€™s a holiday pack to be specific. I could not believe my eyes when seeing the price tag, especially after seeing that an 8 pack goes for 12 euros.

Itâ€™s a wonderful gift for myself ðŸ˜‚ But man, can you taste the difference between canned and bottled. Canned has a lighter body, and goes down realllly smooth. While bottled comes through with that wonderful hoppynes and a bitter aftertaste, while being more foamy and consistent. I am drinking the 3rd bottle with the same joy as I was drinking the first. 

My next step is to get a small keg of this. I mean, if itâ€™s this good from a bottle, how much better could it be unpasteurised from the factory? Come onnn, itâ€™s not fair.

I also bought an Erdinger? Wheat beer, first time drinking one and man, is it good. That light texture, canâ€™t even taste the alcohol and the aftertaste which I canâ€™t describe. 

I love beer. "

One of the things I had loved about Asheville and WNC was the abundance and diversity of the breweries. Big or small, corporate or quirky - always fun and willing to try new things. Known as ""Beer City"". The destruction from Helene and the water crisis have devastated the beer community from the largest to the smallest.

I heard that some are still trying to operate or are shifting production or are being creative to stay in business. 

How can we support those struggling to keep things flowing? I have mostly drank locally and want to continue to do that. Do some of the smaller breweries have outlets for product so that we can keep them going until better days. Love to know everyone's thoughts. Cheers."

Trying to remember/find UK stout in a very old style bottle,11,1ghkufo,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1ghkufo/trying_to_rememberfind_uk_stout_in_a_very_old/,6,2024-11-02 07:57:07,"My friend and I absolutely cherished this one beer we used to find at a chain called Earth Fare in the States about a decade ago. Neither of us can remember the name or evidently [correct] enough details to turn it up online. Hoping someone will know what I'm talking about so my friend and I can hopefully find it and enjoy it again.

Very, very old looking bottle design; not perfectly cylindrical, but wider and stouter. Bottle maybe had a little bit of embossed text?
The one we found was a dark beer, I want to say oat stout. From the UK. I believe the label said how it was brewed in an old church or at least used the well of an old church/abbey. These details keep turning up Sam Smith but that's not the one. Sam Smith has a cylindrical bottle and the label covers more of it. The fabled beer didn't have the yellow color scheme either. I'm fairly confident it was in fact from the UK and not a Belgian one but perhaps that's memory playing tricks.

Hoping that rings a bell to someone because I'd kill to find it again, or at least know what it was. Thank you!"

I'm taking a train to Frankfurt on Saturday so figured it would be best to do Brussels last. 

Are most places still open in December? Does the weather affect public transportation much? How difficult is it to get out to the Westvleteren cafe via public transportation?

My sour tolerance is not what it once was so while I'll probably at least swing by Cantillon I will probably try to stick to the more funky and non-sour side of things.

I come to you with a kind of peculiar question, since you lot seem to be the most knowledgeable with regards to that.
I have a dear friend who can, for allergy reasons, not drink wine in any form. However, she would really like to know what it tastes like/have at least an approximation. I want to help her out. I distinctly remember once drinking a beer called â€œNottinghamâ€ by Kehrwieder Kreativbrauerei from Hamburg â€“ while it definitely did not taste the same as wine, for someone who has never drunk any wine I would say it could be an okay approximation in a more interesting way than drinking, say, single-grape juice.
So my question to you: Did you lot ever have a barleywine that tasted a little bit/as close as possible to actual (red) wine? I would buy a Nottingham, but they do not seem to make it anymore. I am situated in Northern Germany, but for this special friend and project I would be ready to import a beer from anywhere.

Which I'm always hesitant to do when I'm unsure whether I'll actually like it.

I bought the following :

* Fuller's London Pride
* McEwans Champion (didn't find Export)
* Shepherd Neame Bishops Finger (didn't find 1698 Old Ale)
* Brewdog Shore Leave
* Hobgoblin Ruby
* Timothy Taylor's Landlord (couldn't find Dark Landlord)
* The Kernel Export Stout 1890
* Tynt Meadow (really curious about that one!)
* Cerberus 2022 Imperial Stout
* Elusive Brewing Mince Pie Barley Wine
* Yonder Rocky Road Pastry Stout
* Tartarus Moon Rabbit

For whatever reason they have the reputation of being an Australian beer when they're actually English I think. I like they because of the bulky size of their single cans, their good reliable malty tasty which I enjoyed many times while munching on countless Japanese style peanuts, and finally because I have a core memory associated with the beer.

I was during one of my college Summers my Dad flew me out to his apartment in Newcastle for an internship. It was an exciting time, but I was depressed in college and my parent's relationships were at a nadir, I wouldn't know it at the time but they'd eventually divorce.

Case in point it was a sad time in my life. When I finally reached his apartment I was so tired, a heavy, sleep deprived body tiredness. My Dad bought me the beer and brought me some wasabi flavored Japanese peanuts from Switzerland. They tasted amazing and the beer really helped me relax. I remember just sitting in his living room couch enjoying my ""dinner"" just before a nice warm shower. I wasn't watching anything on TV, just catching up with Dad.

My fiancÃ© and his dad used to get a growler and beer for a long time neighbor every Halloween but his dad passed away earlier this year. We donâ€™t know the kind of beer his dad used to buy but we wanted to uphold the old tradition. 

We could ask, but we kind of want it to be a surprise since the tradition kind of fazed out after my father in law moved away and leaving us the house to live in. Also, itâ€™s become a little more rare seeing our neighbor outside and striking up a convo.

So of course this is purely subjective and can be a hit or miss, but Iâ€™m curious, what kind of beer would you suggest for a 70+ Midwestern man?

EDIT: Just thought Iâ€™d add; I know little to nothing about beer so hopefully this isnâ€™t a dumb question. But if itâ€™s not too dumb, any suggestions, whether itâ€™s different brands or types/ingredients, anything would be helpful!

EDIT 2: We ended up getting a decently well liked lager from a local brewery. Thank you so much for all of your suggestions and recommendations! "

Housebeer recommendations,0,1g6f3c3,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1g6f3c3/housebeer_recommendations/,33,2024-10-18 17:45:04,"Iâ€™ve been into craft beer for a loooong time. Every beer I put into my mouth has been an orgasm. Love IPAs especially. 

Butâ€¦ Iâ€™m tired. Iâ€™m tired of thinking about it, running around to get the best one. 

I feel like Iâ€™m easing into my â€œCarlsbergâ€ years. I just want to stock my fridge with a 24 and not overthink it. Iâ€™m ready for a house beer.

The problem is, despite all the craft breweries around, Iâ€™m finding it hard to nail one down that fits my criteria, so Iâ€™m hoping for some help.

Hereâ€™s what I am looking for:
-available in 355cans or even better 341bottles.
-ideally available in bulk and not TOO expensive though that is relative and am willing to pay if needed
-ideally craft beer but Iâ€™m starting to think none will fit this bill so open to â€˜gaspâ€™ macro
-5%abv or less
-available in Ontario - and delivery across Ontario as Iâ€™m in Kingston

So far, Iâ€™ve tried
-Muskoka detour (not as good as it used to be. I had high hopes for this one but nope)
-lug lite (not off the table but not great)
-Muskoka tread lightly (loathed it)
-miller high life (sad to this this one is currently in the lead :()
-miller lite (tied with high life)
-side launch light lager (this one isnâ€™t bad)
-Modelo especial (donâ€™t like the beer but has a little skunk that is nostalgic which I kinda did)
-blood brothers blood light (this is my top beer from the category but get expensive since they donâ€™t sell by the case and need to pay shipping)
-Carlsberg (didnâ€™t try because you canâ€™t get in bottles anywhere around here)


On a side note: I LOATHE that every craft brewery is doing tall boys right now. IMHO if youâ€™re doing a light beer and putting it in tall boys youâ€™re doing it wrong. (I assume this was LCBOâ€™s doing so reckon they deserve the blame). 

Pretty close to just giving up and officially starting my Miller years."

Iâ€™m gearing up for an interview with a major player in the beer industry and could really use some recommendations for quality podcasts or news websites. Specifically, Iâ€™m looking for content that covers:

* Key players in the beer industry
* Current trends and market insights
* Craft beer, but not too narrowly focused on it
* Statistics, industry growth, and broader trends

Iâ€™d prefer podcasts that provide a well-rounded view of the industry, rather than focusing too deeply on just one niche (e.g., only craft beer). Any suggestions for podcasts or sites that cover the big picture would be super helpful!

Just curious, I went on the website to see some details and lo and behold, itâ€™s not only returning nationwide but in 12 packs of cans.

Iâ€™m always excited to see breweries bring back old flagships and fan favorites. Itâ€™s probably been 5-6 years since Iâ€™ve had a honkers ale (I think I had a tall draft at an Uno pizzeria before it disappeared) and Iâ€™m hoping itâ€™s just like I remember.

Has anyone seen it on shelves around their area yet? The beer finder on GIâ€™s website doesnâ€™t appear to have been updated with their distro yet. "

"What would it take for British style ales (Bitters, Milds, and Pales) to become popular in the US again?",27,1g1ohus,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1g1ohus/what_would_it_take_for_british_style_ales_bitters/,58,2024-10-12 07:40:57,"The beer that really kickstarted my love of beer was Fuller's ESB. Before I had that when I was 21, I really only drank craft beers because they were stronger and could give you a good buzz faster (Victory Golden Monkey, Lagunitas Brown Shugga, Weyerbacher Merry Monks, etc). But I started reading around and trying new beers and styles for the fun of it, not just to get drunk. I'll always remember having Fuller's ESB for the first time. I was so amazed by the whole experience of how complex the malts were, how much I loved the fruity esters, and how the herbal hops used really balanced it all out. This was in around 2018-ish, and unfortunately since then so many English ales aren't available anymore. Fuller's ESB is gone. Hobgoblin ruby isn't available near me anymore. The more mass produced examples (which weren't really as good anyway) have also disappeared (red hook ESB, honker's ale etc).   


Last April I had the privelidge of going to NERAX (New England Real Ale Exhibiton) and got to try so many cask ales from the UK and US. I'm 27, but I felt like a baby there with the average age probably being in the mid-to-late 40s. It was fascinating to learn how influential British beer styles and brewing culture were to the early craft beer movement in the US. Now, coming upon a British style at a store or a brewery is extemely uncommon. 

  
My question is this. Right now in the US, lagers are making a huge comeback as people are looking for something drinkable and lower ABV that is sessionable. Why aren't British styles a part of this resurgence? They are often even lower in ABV than many lager styles, and are often much more complex and interesting. From an economic standpoint, I believe they are also cheaper to brew as they do not require extended storage. What gives? What's stopping these amazing styles from becoming more of a staple in the craft beer scene in the US?"

I can't remember anything aside from the first letter of the brand, which is a ""K"". It was a tall glass with many ""drawings"" on it of like a black farm/farm house and some writings that talked about the origin of the brand i think.  
I got the glass when i stayed at the Connacht Hotel in Galway. I've already looked at brands such as KÃ¶nigsegger and Kronenbourg but they don't match the glass. Thanks to everyone in advance!"

Nostalgic beer,5,1fwt9zc,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1fwt9zc/nostalgic_beer/,14,2024-10-05 22:43:57,"Hi!

Picture this. Ontario. 1988.

Iâ€™m a 9 year old boy. My dad leaves the room, and I take a sip of his beer. Itâ€™s gross. I hate it. But the taste makes an imprint.

Skunky. A bit vegetal.

I grew up, got into craft beer. IPAs, DIPAs, Imperial Stouts, sours.

All great - but Iâ€™ve still yet to taste that taste that I remember.

The closest was a Pacifico on vacation once. But I canâ€™t get that in Ontario.

The only clue I have is that I know my dad drank Oâ€™keefe at one point. But I canâ€™t get that here.

I imagine itâ€™s a taste found in macro beer? Iâ€™ve tried a couple with no luck. I tried Miller Lite and it had a hint of it in the first sip but then it disappeared.

So, I guess Iâ€™m wondering, what beers should I try that might have that nostalgic, skunky, mildly vegetal 80s dad beer taste? Know what I mean?"
Miller Highlife question,0,1fwqz1q,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1fwqz1q/miller_highlife_question/,28,2024-10-05 20:56:24,"Until this week I havenâ€™t drank Miller Highlife in months. My mom had a regular 12oz bottle of MHL in her fringe for months and didnâ€™t have any other beer so I took it upon myself to drink it and it tasted awful. Wasnâ€™t very bubbly for being the champagne of beers and had an extremely sweet corn syrupy flavor to it. I ended up only drinking half of it and havenâ€™t had it again until this week.

Earlier this week I was dying for a beer and was a day away from payday so I settled for a $1.69 32 oz bottle of Miller Highlife and it was so good I had to go by three more today. Perfect balance of light and flavorful. Easily chuggable and pleasantly sippable.

My question is, has any of you noticed MHL tasting better out of the big bottles as opposed to the standard 12oz variety? Or was the one in my momâ€™s fridge just too old? Iâ€™ve finished all three and have yet to taste that offputting sweet corn syrupy note."

The team at Burial Brewing in Asheville has been feeding the community and directing folks to fundraisers as they recover from the catastrophic flooding of Hurricane Helene (I know others like DSSOLVR are helping, but they're who I follow on Instagram). I emailed them to see if I could donate to them to help them with their efforts, and [as promised](https://old.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1fu4fei/asheville_breweries_devastated_by_helene_flooding/lq2fzz1/), here's the email I received:

---

Good Morning Folks,

I want to start by saying thank you to each of you who reached out to offer support. Itâ€™s been overwhelming to keep up with in the best possible way. Hearing from you is keeping us optimistic and moving forward. Iâ€™d also like to thank you for your patience as we tried to wrap our heads around where and how to direct these offers.

Weâ€™ve spent the past few days sorting through the abundance of information thatâ€™s out there and have settled on the following as a start.

**For those looking to support Burial Beer Co.:**

* **Overview** - As of Tuesday, October 1st, we have been in contact with 100% of Burial's Asheville Staff. Everyone is safe and accounted for. We're considering ourselves incredibly lucky that our Asheville locations did not sustain any major damage. Unfortunately, many of our friends and neighbors cannot say the same. Our timeline on reopening any Burial AVL locations will largely rely on the city's ability to re-establish a potable and running water supply, which we've heard may take weeks and up to months. That being said, our main focus right now is supplying hot meals, cold water, dry goods, feminine products, gas, and electricity to both our staff and the community.
* **Physical Donations** -
Both our Charlotte and Raleigh Taprooms are accepting donations that will be delivered to our South Slope Asheville Taproom. Additionally, UPS and FedEx have resumed service to Asheville. If you're interested and able to send dry goods, feminine products, or bottled water, our address is:
  * [40 Collier Ave, Asheville, NC 28801](https://www.google.com/maps/search/40+Collier+Ave,+Asheville,+NC+28801?entry=gmail&source=g)
* **Volunteering** -
We are thankful to have the resources on our staff to handle our limited Asheville operations at the moment. For those of you looking to volunteer, we'd like to direct you to: volunteer@buncombecounty.org.
* **Financial Support** -
  * [GoFundMe for Asheville Hospitality Staff](https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-asheville-coworkers-in-recovery-together) - Our Charlotte Taproom Manager, Alissa Gavin, has created a fund that will benefit our AVL Bartenders and Kitchen Employees currently unable to work. 
  * [Charlotte](https://burialbeer.com/pages/charlotte-house-of-relics) & [Raleigh](https://burialbeer.com/pages/raleigh-the-exhibit) Taprooms - Both locations are currently open with standard operations. Come say hi to our teams, enjoy some pours, and take some beer to-go.
  * [Online Shop](https://burialbeer.com/pages/delivery-asheville-pickup) - Our Online Shop for Beer and Merchandise Shipping is active. We're working to catch up on orders received during the storm, as well as the new orders coming in each day. Shipping will likely be a bit slower than you're used to from us, but we will get you the goods as soon as we possibly can.
I know this is a lot, but please let me know if you have any questions. I will do my best to get back to everyone as quickly as possible.


Thank you,
The Burial Beer Co. Team"

ColdFire Brewingâ€™s â€œFlavor Policeâ€ â€“ A Rant About Customer Choice and Brewery Elitism,0,1fv2ccb,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1fv2ccb/coldfire_brewings_flavor_police_a_rant_about/,34,2024-10-03 14:36:25,"Iâ€™ve got to say, Iâ€™ve had some great times at ColdFire Brewing Company in Eugene, Oregon. They make solid beer, and Iâ€™ve enjoyed supporting a local spot. But tonight? They really lost me with one of the most pretentious policies Iâ€™ve ever come across in any brewery.

Iâ€™ve been to breweries all over the country and made the same simple request at all of them: half IPA, half cider. I like the sweetness of the cider mixed with the hoppiness of the IPAâ€”itâ€™s a combo that works for me. But apparently, ColdFire doesnâ€™t care what its customers like. When I ordered this, the server told me itâ€™s company policy not to honor requests like this because (Iâ€™m paraphrasing here), the brewers work â€œreally hardâ€ to create flavor profiles, and customers need to â€œhonor that.â€ Yeah, really.

What? I thought I walked into a brewery, not the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld. â€œNo mixed drinks for you!â€ I made that exact comparison to the server, who looked at me like Iâ€™d just insulted their entire family. Seriously, though, the snobby disdain in the response was just off-putting.

And hereâ€™s the thing: Iâ€™ve never had a pub, bar, or brewery deny this simple request, which Iâ€™ve made dozens of times over many years at all kinds of places. But ColdFire? Theyâ€™re so wrapped up in their self-importance that they actually enforce this ridiculous policy, as if theyâ€™re doing us a favor by refusing what we like.

And letâ€™s get one thing straightâ€”denying a customerâ€™s requestâ€”even if it seems a bit weirdâ€”should NEVER be a company policy at a food and beverage establishment or anywhere in the service industry. The customerâ€™s preferences reign supreme, especially over the pride and ego of the chefs or, in this case, the brewers. Customers come to enjoy themselves, not be told their tastes are wrong.

FOOD AND DRINK IS PERSONAL. What tastes good to one person might taste like absolute trash to another. People alter their food and drinks to suit their own tastes all the time. Imagine a steakhouse refusing to give you salt because â€œthe chef seasoned it to perfection,â€ or an ice cream shop rejecting your request for two different flavors because â€œour chef determined those donâ€™t go together.â€ Itâ€™s absurd, right? But here we are.

ColdFire, youâ€™ve officially become one of the most pretentious and out-of-touch establishments in Eugene. Congratulations. Newsflash: customers come to enjoy themselves, not to bow down to some snobby, self-important idea of what â€œshouldâ€ be good. And the fact that Iâ€™ve never had a single other place deny this request? That just makes your policy all the more ridiculous.

So, has anyone else had this experience? Is this really the hill ColdFire wants to die on? Curious to hear if this is a one-off or if other people have noticed a shift in the customer experience here. Also curious if anyone knows the name of the owner(s)."

> These are the sectors that could be the most impacted by the strike:

> Food and Beverage: The dozen or so U.S. ports affected by the strike import nearly $100 million a month of beverages and vinegar, according to a report from the Washington Post. According to the American Farm Bureau Federation via the Washington Post, 80% of all imported beer, whiskey, scotch and more come through the ports will be impacted by the strike.

> Constellation Brands. The maker of Modelo, is one of the companies that imports the most beer to the U.S., although Constellation may be able to avoid disruptions caused by the port through ground transportation from Mexico. Heineken NV and other European beverage companies may feel more of the strikeâ€™s affects.

The longshoreman strikes on the East Coast may cause the prices on imported beer, wine, and spirits to increase, as well as supply to decrease.  Some of the more popular imported brands like Modelo, Corona, Guinness and Heineken may see price increases and be harder to find.  If you regularly drink imported beer, you may want to stock up in case prices increase."

I tapped a keg of Coors last week with one of those ""Party Pumps."" The tap ended up breaking, so we only got 6-10 beers out of it before it was out for commissionâ€”we did not have another tap on hand. We put it in our basement (which is a bit cooler).

  
Do you think it's safe to tap this upcoming Friday(So the beer would be 14 days tapped)? I'm not as concerned with taste, after all, it is keg beer, more with general safety.

So as of last Friday, Iâ€™m now 21!!! To be honest for a second, Iâ€™ve had some beers here or there in the last year at family get togethers and parties with friends.

I want to see whatâ€™s out there in the beer world, try a little bit of everything I suppose! If it helps, the beers Iâ€™ve had so far are as follows:

-Bud Light
-Samuel Adams (Oktoberfest, Winter Lager, Summer Ale)
-Corona 
- Blue Moon

Given the ones I listed, I really enjoyed the Samuel Adams flavors the most. Blue Moon being second place, Corona third, and Bud Light being last. Thatâ€™s not because I donâ€™t like it, it just doesnâ€™t excite my palate much. 

What suggestions/recommendations do yâ€™all have?"

Using a c-DGM Gehaltemeter for RTD,1,1fsucz5,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1fsucz5/using_a_cdgm_gehaltemeter_for_rtd/,1,2024-09-30 19:31:14,"Hello Hello, I have a question slightly outside the beer topic, but I know some breweries also produce RTD beverages. The other day, we were canning Cuba Libre, and something happened with the carbonation. Everything was measured using a c-DGM Gehaltemeter Haffmans CO2/O2, calibrated and clean:

* Carbonation in the BBT: 2.71 vol.
* Carbonation inline, at the filler inlet: 2.70 vol.
* Carbonation in the cans (average of 35 cans): 2.14 vol.

The cans were randomly selected from the packaging line and refrigerated until they reached an approximate temperature of 32-33 Â°F.

My question is the following: during the measurement, if I didnâ€™t fully open the flow on the equipment, the temperature didnâ€™t drop enough, showing a higher reading (the liquid was about 33 Â°F, but the equipment read 37 Â°F). For this type of product, where Iâ€™m only measuring CO2, what is the correct procedure? (I've never got this kind of problems with the beer, so, im asking for RTD).  Should I fully open the flow until the measurement stabilizes? If so, why does the pressure drop so much, and consequently the carbonation, when there was no breakout or foaming during filling?

Additionally, could it be that the CO2 loss is happening during filling and not due to incorrect measurement? Since this beverage has no proteins (unlike beer, which does allow CO2 retention), would it be advisable to add some additive to improve foam retention in the liquid? Thanks any comment is welcome!"

I've been doing some research online, and it has lead me to things like milk stout, oatmeal stout, tropical stout and honey beer. I have to admit that I've ignored stout beers due to disliking Guinness. But apparently that's an imperial stout? The guesthouse I'm staying at is above an Irish pub, so I'm assuming they'll have quite a few stouts for me to try.

My current ""list"" of beers to try (or bring with me) consists of only 2 beers atm : Left Hand Nitro Milk Stout and Samuel Smith oatmeal stout. I'd love to expand this list with some other sweet British beers. Doesn't necessarily have to be stout.

Thanks in advance!"

After the 16th century, beers began to regularly include this ingredient. For years, only a mixture of herbs and spices was used to slightly alter its flavor, around the 1100s AD.

The nun **Hildegard von Bingen** (1098-1179), in a German monastery, wrote a treatise on the benefits of hops, beer, and the use of hops in it. Based on the fact that sweet drinks were heavily consumed, which led to vision problems and blindness, Hildegard suggested that the bitterness of beer counteracted the overconsumption of such beverages.

Thanks to Hildegard, hops were identified as growing in the chapel of Bavaria and became recognized as a key ingredient in beer. It wasnâ€™t until 1400 that hops reached the Netherlands, and in 1519 it was condemned as a bad herb. Not until the 16th century was it included as a basic ingredient."

Guinness Extra Stout. Itâ€™s %0.4 weaker than the Irish version. It lacks body, flavor, and is fizzy as if thereâ€™s zero nitro in it. Nitro or not itâ€™s just way more fizzy and empty tasting.

Grolsch. Honestly itâ€™s been awhile since I drank an original. But this is flabby and barely palatable. It should be a little more hop sharp and slightly sea sprayâ€™esque.

The problem here is if youâ€™ve never experienced the originals you either like the under contract versions for what they are or you donâ€™t. And I think that Molson and maybe a little less so Labatt, have always wanted to homogenize and lower the expectations of the beer drinking experience.

Or perhaps this is a result of their vertical integration of procuring grains and hops, combined with their standardized brewing process.

Either way Iâ€™m done with these companies. If you agree contact your local convenience stores and grocery to pressure them to have variety."

They run on 100% wind power, have an impressive water conservation system, and even use a methane-powered co-gen engine to turn waste into energy. Plus, they're a certified B Corporation, which is always good!

- Camden Town Brewery (Camden Town, London):Â Despite supporting the worst team in North London, Camden Town Brewery is dedicated to sustainability, using 100% renewable electricity, recycling brewing waste, and minimising material use in packaging. They also conserve water and collaborate with local farmers and a UK charity to reduce environmental impact.

- Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. (California, USA):Â Known for their zero-waste initiative, Sierra Nevada recycles or reuses nearly 100% of their waste. They've also invested heavily in solar energy and have one of the largest privately-owned solar arrays in the U.S. Their commitment to water conservation and sustainable agriculture is also top-notch.

- To Ã˜l (Copenhagen, Denmark):Â To Ã˜l operates out of a facility they've dubbed ""To Ã˜l City,"" which is all about zero-waste and circular economy principles. They're using local, organic ingredients and innovative packaging solutions that make their operations as sustainable as possible.

What could be wrong with this beer?,11,1fmmgdq,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1fmmgdq/what_could_be_wrong_with_this_beer/,18,2024-09-22 13:00:10,"I just came back from Japan and really loved Asahi beer when I was there.  I am in Saigon Vietnam now and grabbed a few Asahis at 7-11 but the moment I took a sip from the first one, I knew something was off.  Not only did it not taste the same, but I have never tasted a beer that tasted like some sort of chemical in my entire life.  It was very pronounced.  I cracked open another one and same thing.  I asked my wife to take a sip and she immediately agreed something is way off.  I then inspected the can and it said this on the side. 

â€œby Shenzhen Tsingtao Beer
Asahi Breweries, Ltd., Tokyoâ€
www.asahisuperdry.com

I assumed it was from Japan, but I guess it is a Chinese brewed one, but why so different and why such an awful chemical taste?  Surely Asahi has quality control?  What could have caused this?  Left in the hot sun?  Did I drink a fake beer?   Has anyone had this experience with other beers?  

Also, unsure if related, but about an hour after having those sips (maybe 2 oz/60ml total) my toes on both my feet suddenly curled up with the most intense cramp I have ever experienced and it took 30 mins of massage and hot water to calm them down. I rarely get cramped toes and never for more than a second or two on one foot so this was a big surprise.  So much so that it has me wondering if that beer was poison in some way?  I looked into causes of extreme toe cramps and the only possible thing that jumped out was poisoning as there was no other cause that rang as even possible.  

Will post on a Vietnam subreddit as maybe the locals have some insights.

Hi ! First time here. Question about hoppy beers :,14,1fj3kej,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1fj3kej/hi_first_time_here_question_about_hoppy_beers/,42,2024-09-17 23:23:25,"Hi, I hope You're all well.

My question is the following : can Somebody give me some explanation in re the worldwide hops trend ? What I mean is : what happened ? I remember my earlier youth (I'm 34 now), when I was in my teens, in Chile, and nowhere would You find anything termed Â« IPA Â», or Â« APA Â», nor any Â« special Â» beer, and no beer would have hops flavour. All there was was bottled beers (or canned) which You'd get at shops, and they were just... what I'd call Â« regular Â» beers. No hops.

But then all of a sudden (well, if You can call a decade or couple of decades as Â« sudden Â»), suddenly hops everywhere. And specialty beers, and bars that make their special beers, etc. And it seems to Me that this happened quite all over the world. Again : IPAs, APAs, ales, hops and hops.

Can Somebody explain ?, if there's something to be explained beyond just telling Me Â« it's a trend Â» ?

Thank-You very much,  
good-day."

CO2/Keg advice,3,1fgr3vn,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1fgr3vn/co2keg_advice/,4,2024-09-15 00:17:58,"Hello. I am having a problem with my new keg setup and Iâ€™m having trouble finding anyone with a similar issue online. 

I got this set up a month ago. Two sixel kegs in a kegerator hooked up to two taps. I have attached a 5 lb CO2 tank to the kegs. 

For the first week it ran no problems. The pours were foamy but after fiddling with the pressure levels I got it pouring well. Then the CO2 tank ran out with both kegs still about half full. I rubbed soap on all the points of escape and found a leak, applied sealant to it and it stopped leaking there. Hooked up a new tank and it poured well, but less than a week later, same problem. The kegs were empty now, replaced them, hooked up a new tank and couldnâ€™t find another leak. 

This is the part where Iâ€™m not finding anyone with the same issue. I followed some instructions I found online:

1. pressurize the regulator until the low pressure gauge is reading 10 psi

2. close the valve between the regulator and the hose and shut off the tank 

The instructions said the pressure should stay the same. What happened was they stayed the same for two minutes, then quickly increased to 25 psi, before suddenly dropping to zero. I tried this twice and the same thing happened each time. 

This is a full tank of CO2 and when I set everything up normally it is pouring beer out of both taps no issue, but I am confused about why my tanks are going empty so fast. 

Has anyone had an issue like this before? Iâ€™m thinking I may need to replace the regulator? Iâ€™m not sure what other troubleshooting to do and I want advice from people more experienced than me before I spend more money on this thing. 

Thank you. "

My wedding is a month away and I'm getting two 1/2 barrel kegs for the event. 

I've never gotten kegs before so I don't really know what size container for ice I need to keep them cold the day of the event. 

I planned on getting some cheap insulated jackets for them and I want to get two containers I can set them in and fill will ice. They'll be inside the venue for the reception. I will probably pick them up late that morning (maybe like 1030 or 11), load them in my truck and drive up to the venue spot about 20 minutes from me, unload them then head out to get some ice. The wedding start time is 5pm. 

I see a keg is about 16"" diameter and I'm seeing containers that are a 17.5"" width. Do I need something wider? Taller? What would you recommend? I'm picking them up from a local bar, and the guy said he would keep them in the 40 degree cooler in the back for me with their other kegs, do I even need the insulated jackets?

I'm looking for advice...

I am looking to add 6 new draught keg beer lines to my licensed premesis which I own freehold. Currently there is no celllar and I have no taps.

I have all planning and licensing in order for a new cellar area and 6 lines, the cellar being behind the current bar (under 5 meters from keg to tap in a straight line) I am very capable doing any building out work, drilling walls for trunking, connecting things up ect.

However my knowledge of how to design this system is limited to speaking with equipment suppliers and reading/watching websites/YouTube.

At the moment Im thinking I could have a stab at creating this system, buying and installing the parts myself. However I'm concerned I may hit pitfalls or poorly design it. 

I will not be doing the phyiaical cellar room build or the electrics/cellar cooling myself. I am only considering creating the keg draught system.

Is there any good information/resources/recommend training you can share given the above.

If I'm way off the mark and I'm crazy to even attempt it, please let me know aswell.

Thank you.

To me, Guinness is a great session beer that is widely available, but my main complaint has always been that it's just a touch too expensive for what it is. This rebate knocks it down to the $1 per 12oz territory (if you're buying the nitro 8 packs), which is pretty great (it's about $15-16 at my grocery store).

I buy Guinness semi-regularly so I've been taking full advantage. The money is typically venmoed to you in a few days.  I think there's a limit of 4 uses per month per person.

Sierra Nevadaâ€™s selection this year is a festbier as well. Is this the year it finally makes it big in America alongside the traditional MÃ¤rzen?

For the unaware, there are two styles of German Oktoberfest bier. In America, we generally only see the older style called MÃ¤rzen, which is an amber very malty style that was traditionally aged half a year (hence the name. Most is not aged nowadays and the flavor is achieved via other means though some still age theirs). 

The more modern variant is known as festbier and is somewhere in between a MÃ¤rzen and a standard helles lager. Malty, slightly hoppy, easy drinking with a surprising kick of alcohol. It was generally very hard to find in the US outside of certain imports, compared to MÃ¤rzen. "

Looking to find information on brands that sell well abroad, market themselves as being culturally tied to their native country but actually have very little market share or respect in their native homeland.
The famous example of this is Fosters that sells well outside of Australia and is almost a famous cultural icon of Australia in US and Europe but is virtually unseen in Australia.


Also fake brands. I understand Madri is British but has a Spanish identity. Ive even heard a rumour it uses a recipe extremely close to Carling Black Label and is just a pure marketing ploy."

Countries where you can commonly buy real ale?,20,1f95szp,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1f95szp/countries_where_you_can_commonly_buy_real_ale/,81,2024-09-05 04:56:04,"I know you can buy it in pubs in England, Scotland, and Wales (not all pubs but all cities will give you the option without too much hassle). It's not available in Germany though. Maybe Ireland and Belgium but I haven't been so I'm not sure?

Let's define commonly as being able to reliably find a pub with real ale in any city. Real ale is defined as ""Beer brewed from traditional ingredients, matured by secondary fermentation in the container from which it is dispensed, and served without the use of extraneous carbon dioxide."" by Wiktionary.

The reason why I ask is that I love bitter but will probably have to leave the UK for some years at least to pursue a career in academia.

Edit: some confusion about real ale vs ale. Real ale is a subset of ale. It has been pointed out to me that a better word to use might be cask beer. I'm not asking where you can get any ale because Guinness is ubiquitous but not what I want."

My boyfriend is British. He went to England last year to visit family, and drank his fair share (a lot, as he should) of good British beer. And ever since then he has been RAVING about John Smithâ€™s Extra Smooth Ale. 

He will only drink Boddingtons and Belhaven Scottish Ale/Belhaven Black Stout now, with the occasional FORGD Stout or Guinness Draught at the bar or when a restaurant wonâ€™t let you BYO. But he says nothing comes close to the taste of authentic John Smithâ€™s from his dadâ€™s hometown in England. 

Is it sold in the U.S. at all? I live in New Jersey, between the Newark-Trenton area. Iâ€™m willing to pay $200 to get him as much as I can as a Christmas gift. 

If not, how would I go about importing it? Itâ€™s for personal use, obviously, but would I need a permit or documents for it? I found a 24 pack on a site called McGrocer that says it can ship to the U.S. via UPS, but I donâ€™t want to buy it and have it seized by customs if thereâ€™s something else I need to do to get it here. 

In the meantime, what would be a good substitute that I can recommend to him? Basically the closest to the Extra Smooth Ale that you can get in the U.S.?

Anything helps!!!

EDIT: I FOUND IT!

So it definitely is not found in the states, you guys were right about that. But I did some research on just importing it and it was so much easier than I thought. I went with that company that I mentioned before, McGrocer. I was able to (very expensively) ship a case of 18 cans from the UK to the U.S. for a whopping Â£91.36 (or about $135 at the time I ordered it). All I had to do was email them a picture of my ID to validate that I was of legal age in the U.S. to purchase alcohol, and they sent it right to my door. No import hassle whatsoever. Itâ€™s hiding safely under my bed out of sight from my man until Christmas. Cannot wait to see the look on his face when he realizes he can have a taste of the place he loves most whenever he wants (up to 18 cans of it). Thanks for all the suggestions, I really appreciate it!"

He does drink Guinness if that helps with any suggestions. I have found that coffee/chocolate flavouring is in both so that may be something...I don't know lol. 

I am in calgary, alberta, canada. And was wondering if there may be another brand that would have the same taste as hibgoblin that I could get him.

Iâ€™ve been sampling cask ales around town (Stockholm) and so far been let down. Right now Iâ€™m trying Timothy Taylorâ€™s Boltmaker (tried Knowle Spring Blonde too) from a reputable bar (it has the â€œCask Marqueâ€ certification and a Timothy Taylor Champion Club plaque)

To me, the beer is slightly too warm (not cold enough), slightly too flat, and lacking anything that stands out flavor wise. I get that the point is for it to be this way, but the only substance Iâ€™m getting is a tea like astringency. A little dusty. 

The only one Iâ€™ve liked decent was a darker mild; it felt more appropriate for a darker beer, creamier, smooth. 

I respect these bars so maybe itâ€™s just a me thing. I havenâ€™t traveled to the UK and wonâ€™t give up yet. But for now Iâ€™d prefer the beer on normal draft. "

Discontinued beer ,21,1ezjydg,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1ezjydg/discontinued_beer/,99,2024-08-24 01:24:00,"Have you ever had your favourite beer discontinued? 
There used to be a beer called Makara, it was a Nepalese/English collaboration lager served at our local nepalese restaurant, unfortunately the Kent brewery that produced it went bust in 2015.

It was a really malty larger, like peroni red but on steroids,
I've pretty much drank every nepalese beer since & nothing comes close.

Has anyone else had their favourite beer discontinued?"
AC Golden brewery (Coors craft beer) closing next month.,19,1ezfeh8,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1ezfeh8/ac_golden_brewery_coors_craft_beer_closing_next/,17,2024-08-23 22:18:47,"I visited Golden, CO last month and really enjoyed Coors' Native Colorado line of 7 or so beers as well as the long-pour tap AC Golden Barmen pilsner.   I just read this from AI at Google:



""*Molson Coors announced that it will close AC Golden Brewing Co., an experimental beer brand, by the end of September 2024.Â The company's chief commercial officer, Michelle St. Jacques, said the closure will allow Molson Coors to focus on its premium national brands, such as Blue Moon and Leinenkugel, as well as non-beer alcoholic beverages.Â AC Golden was founded in 2007, then called MillerCoors, as an effort to compete with small-batch beer makers.Â The brand was known for its Colorado Native beers, which featured locally grown ingredients.Â AC Golden was located within the Coors plant in Golden.*""



Well, that's a shame.  Their Native Colorado beers were very well made and quite enjoyable.  I don't taste many craft lagers that have the mature taste like what Coors' craft beers had.



Colorado, however, seems well stocked with craft breweries right now."

I never really got into beer until I visited Munich in 2015. Since then, Hefeweizens have been my go to beers. I've tried several, and here is my take.

Weihenstephan - this is the one where I notice variations from batch to batch, so it's a bit or miss for me. I've noticed that some have a stronger note of clove, and I really don't like them. The ones I've gotten that had strong banana note, I think are the best I've had. But again, it's inconsistent in my opinion, so it's not my go to.

KÃ¶nig Ludwig Weissbier- it's been a few years since I've had it, so I can't really comment on specifics, but I know that it's probably almost my favorite or at least top 3

Franziskaner- I don't think it's quite as good as the  best weihenstephans or Ludwig's ive had, but it's very consistent, and (at least for me) easy to find. I'd describe this one as a more bready taste.

I had some of the Hofbrau Hefeweizen last week, it was pretty good, but seemed a bit more bitter than other Hefeweizens.

Ive probably tried the Hefeweizens from most or all of the Munich breweries, but none of them were memorable enough for me to comment on or good enough for me to have continue purchasing.

What are your favorite Hefeweizens?"

There are always those people at the bar that add a pinch of salt to ""enhance"" flavors or to make it less flat - IMO I'm not a fan.

Just with a quick google search, [Guinness Nitrosurge | Official Global Site](https://nitrosurge.guinness.com/en/), seems to have a device for specialty beer cans. However, you have to use special cans that are not sold in the US. IMO their US canned beer is nothing like what you get in Ireland, so if this works it would be revolutionary.

Then there are also the machines (like [Amazon.com : Chill-O-Matic Instant Beverage Cooler. You can Chill a 12 Ounce Can of Beer or Soda in just 60 Seconds with This Portable Cooling Device : Home & Kitchen](https://www.amazon.com/Chill-Matic-Automatic-Beverage-Chiller/dp/B01DFPM5PE?th=1)) that get your beer ice cold. This maybe a bigger deal for light beer.

This leads to canned Hazy IPA. These are really impacted by the time they sit on a shelf. I was wondering with the beer expects on this sub: is there are any other ways to make these canned beers taste more consistent?

Other than those above and besides tapping a keg, is there anything I'm missing?"

"Funny story, local liquor store sold me expired beer and refused to believe it. ",17,1eu5cqm,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1eu5cqm/funny_story_local_liquor_store_sold_me_expired/,45,2024-08-17 08:04:55,"I was in the mood for an IPA tonight and I wanted to try something new without driving to a brewery, so I went to my local liquor store and ended up with this 6 pack of Goose Island. Got home to put it in the fridge and noticed the date printed on it was two months out. I know some breweries will print a can date vs an expiration date, but after a quick search apparently Goose Island prints expiration dates. So I went back to the store and showed them the date on the box, and they told me I was wrong and that was the can date, and the expiration date was the one next to it. The serial code. If that were the case it would have expired on December 9th, 2002 even though it was canned on June 24th, 2024. Apparently they think beer retro-expires and they wouldnâ€™t have it, and not wanting to start an argument, I just took it and left. Even if it was December 2024, I would think hop character would significantly degrade in that amount of time. Obviously 5 or 6 month old (from the actual can date) beer wonâ€™t hurt you, but Iâ€™m a little salty they sold me a likely stale 6 pack. Oh well, itâ€™s 7% so itâ€™ll still get me buzzed lmao.

3 days ago I got that email. Without thinking I jumped at the opportunity and forked out $117.30 for a case of 24 tallboys. I watched the tracking like a hawk, excited for the day it would arrive. That day was today!
I put 6 cans in the refrigerator and anxiously awaited the strike of 12pm so I could reasonably drink a beer without feeling like an alcoholic.

Its not because I think wheat beers are boring because I love Allagash White and Hoegaarden but those are witbiers and I think the American Pale Wheat Ale style is vastly inferior and it needs fruit to jazz it up. Its really hot out and I just had a Great Lakes Strawberry Pineapple Wheat and was so good and you could tell they didnt use artificial flavors and only real ingredients. Ive been seeking out all the fruit flavored wheat ales I can find and Im open to suggestions.

Since our last trip 8 years ago my wife developed a medical condition that caused her to give up alcohol. She enjoys non-alcoholic here in the states, mainly Athletic and Guinness 0, but was worried she wouldn't have many options on the trip.

Boy were we wrong.

Almost every pub we visited in London and Edinburgh had multiple options. Most times each new pub would have one or two she hadn't seen yet. On top of that, some places had a non-alcoholic on draught which she was incredibly excited to see (I think it was Lucky Saint that was on draft the few times we saw this).

This allowed her to pub crawl with me and have as much fun with it as I did.

It was really impressive to see how many options there were. Hopefully we see those types of options here in the states soon, especially a draught option here and there."

I like dark chocolate a lot, coffee I tend to add a generous amount of cream and sugar to, and more often than not liquors with a lot of botanicals like gin are enjoyable. So it's not a sweeping dislike of bitterness. Are there any beers that I can look into trying that are not strongly bitter, or perhaps slightly sweet instead of bitter?"

I have seen Guinness mixes online as commonly either 75/25, 70/30, and 60/40 N/Co2. My question is, what is the best for Guinness? And can I run Smithwicks on the same?

If not is there another common beer I can run on the same gas? (In the US, canâ€™t order Kilkenny)

If I canâ€™t double faucetting Guinness is still a blessing of its own. Thanks!"
