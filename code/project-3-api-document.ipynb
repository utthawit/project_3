    "\n",
    "* **Python Knowledge**:\n",
    "You need to know at least a little Python to use PRAW. PRAW supports Python 3.7+. If you have any issues, feel free to discuss with the instructional team.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Reddit Knowledge**:\n",
    "A basic understanding of how Reddit works is a must. In the event you are not already familiar with Reddit start at [**Reddit Help**](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Reddit Account**:\n",
    "A Reddit account is required to access Reddit’s API. Create one at [**reddit.com**](https://www.reddit.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Client ID & Client Secret**:\n",
    "These two values are needed to access Reddit’s API as a script application (see [Authenticating via OAuth](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/authentication.html#oauth) for other application types). If you don’t already have a client ID and client secret, follow [**Reddit’s First Steps Guide**](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/OAuth2-Quick-Start-Example#first-steps) to create them.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **User Agent**:\n",
    "A user agent is a unique identifier that helps Reddit determine the source of network requests. To use Reddit’s API, you need a unique and descriptive user agent. The recommended format is `<platform>:<app ID>:<version string> (by u/<Reddit username>)`. For example, `android:com.example.myredditapp:v1.2.3 (by u/kemitche)`.\n",
